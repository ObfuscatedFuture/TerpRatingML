Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,DO NOT take this class with Maksym Moraswki. His lectures is interesting but has nothing to do with our project/exam. His project description does not match how he grade it.,1,B-,2022-10-17T20:55:12.884947Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Love how the rate my prof ratings are so much better. https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=1822434. 
Exam wasn't that bad as long as you listen to what he says in class. He doesn't always teach everything in lectures, a lot of self learning is expected of you as well; however, he always points out the topics you have to self learn. It is very clear and probably like an hour of learning outside of class a week.",5,A,2022-10-19T19:38:30.116079Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He doesn't know how to teach. He deleted all lecture slides from the previous semester which are rather clear and useful, and teach classes without slides. He also canceled a bunch of classes without trying to make up.",1,,2022-10-26T19:23:52.079928Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Classroom lectures, while interesting, aren't relevant at all to what's actually on the exam, and concepts that are briefly glossed over in class show up as a full-fledged exam question.

Maksym Morawski,,"Cool guy, awful professor. He's always extremely unorganized and unprepared so he just rambles during lecture about things that aren't related to the projects. Additionally, he regularly entertains useless questions that have nothing to do with the class, leading him to go on all sorts of tangents and impromptu comedy bits. He still doesn't understand how to use ELMS, Gradescope, or his class webpage, so from a student's perspective, that makes it really difficult to remember when and where to submit an assignment or take a quiz. Don't take his classes.",1,,2022-11-02T19:58:43.949397Z

First exam was a complete crapshoot, so bad in fact that there was not even a GradeScope timer. Genuinely ignore the 5 star review. I ended up with above a 100% on the exam after this curve to compensate how horrible the exam was (removed 10 points from a 42 exam) and I'm telling you he's horrible. Quite horrible.",1,A-,2022-11-07T02:32:08.936343Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Great guy, very funny, clearly has experience with what he is teaching. While the first midterm we had did have some more vague questions, it was graded very fair with a curve and numerous questions converted to extra credit. Lectures don't always line-up exactly with projects/exams but are interesting in useful in overall terms for data science. Would guarantee most of the reviews on here that are negative are people who aren't putting in effort/starting projects last minute, etc. Would highly recommend for anyone interested in data science and would advise to take most of these negative reviews with a grain of salt/open mind",5,A,2022-11-07T04:02:41.205259Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is a really nice guy and on the first day of class got me excited about the course by telling some very interesting stories about his time in the industry. This was the first time in a CS class that I had been excited to learn or thought to myself, “wow that sounds like something I want to do when I graduate.”

That is why I’m extra disappointed by this class. I suspect that all the Max does to prepare for each day is make a general list of things he wants to talk about and the occasional very plain PowerPoint which he doesn’t stick to. What happens in class is that he simply rambles about said topics without any semblance of structure. There are no key points even if he is using a visual aid. Max will often hand write notes but this is pretty spotty and no one would be able to understand the full picture if they were to try to go back and look at the notes. It is often as if his lectures are simply a conversation between him and people sitting in the front row which quickly breaks down the flow of class and creates too many tangents. It also reveals how unprepared he is when people ask questions and he realizes he should have planned to address that but that it had slipped his mind. This is only a small summary of the issues in this class. Projects are way too hard in comparison for how casually he teaches and test questions seem to be first drafts without any revision. Unless you have the time or personality that would allow you to live in his office hours, don’t expect to get much from Max because his lectures are very difficult to learn from.",1,C,2022-11-07T21:29:23.929820Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"This review is after Maks addressed what has happened in the class and the midterm recently, which is why you are going to wonder why all the 1 star reviews.
I do agree that he isn't the greatest lecturer, and that a lot of topics that he very lightly brushed on the exam came in full force in the midterm, however I am posting this after he gave an EXTREMELY generous curve and on top of that he admitted that a lot of the questions that seemed out of scope of the class or  that were badly written, well that was actually the case, and he made it up within the curve that he gave us.

It's his first time teaching this course, not sure if actually it's his first time lecturing huge sections, and actually. I was frustrated too with his lectures but I can see why he wants us to learn all of this and he is trying to re-make the class. It's to get us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys who just do python,sql, and stuff to whatever we are told to do for the projects. He is a caring and great guy and I have never seen instructors be so caring to the point of admitting their own mistakes and taking student input in order to improve.

There could be more in depth examples and case scenarios for the next exams theory/stat/math wise, and perhaps include a bit of the project stuff in class, but he is great and trying his best at getting us to get the most out of this course.",5,A,2022-11-08T03:49:53.714517Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The way that CMSC320 is being taught in the fall 2022 is a disaster. 
The class was known as a easy CMSC elective class. But it is not this semester. Morawski is a cool, fun guy. Maybe caring according to my friends, but he is far away from good professor this semester. 
He has a few little lecture slides at the beginning of the semester, but no more after he decided to remake the class. We get speaker notes sometimes, but it is only converging the topics he went over. Furthermore, the lectures he gave doesn't teach us how to do our projects and exams well. We basically need to learn how to do the project on our own - it is much workload that I was expecting for CMSC320. It is probably the workload similar to CMSC216. BTW I start projects early so I can ask TA for help, but they are still time consuming and suffering because you have to find out what are expecting (the project description doesn't always tell you where you graded on) and teach yourselves (since you didn't really learn how to do the project yourself)
Also, I do agree that he is trying to make ""us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys"". But we need to think data-wise AND how to code.  
Many of the exams questions went far away from the scope of the class. And some are bad written. The projects we did (and cmsc320 is project heavy class) probably worth 6 points in the 42 points exam (which is 32 after he gave curve). Also there is no timer on the gradescope when we took the exam so we will realize ""we had to time ourselves!"" after you read the exam starts 3-5 mins. 
He might improve next semester (Spring 2023) based on the feedback he got this semester, but honestly, if you have choice, try to wait a semester to see how it went . At this point, I will say he is definitely 1/5 at CMSC320. If you have to, I will suggest to treat this class not as elective CMSC class that is kinda easy as the previous reviews have, treat it as a CMSC216 class that will took your lots efforts to get A.",1,W,2022-11-09T20:00:45.605784Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I really enjoy his class. He makes the material fun and engaging, and added a lot of real world applications to our lessons.

This is his first semester teaching it, and so it's a bit bumpy because of the transition to new material, but he's been doing his best to make it smooth and respond to student feedback",5,A+,2022-11-09T20:22:37.155109Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,Really gracious curve and very responsive to feedback. Really interesting class.,5,A,2022-11-09T20:25:20.819542Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The main issue is poor organization in lecture. Does not provide clear explanations of each topic nor specific examples. Hand written notes are his passing thoughts rather than coherent, structured notes. I often leave class feeling as if I learned nothing. I struggle to take notes because of lack of structure in lectures. Exam was not very relevant to what was covered in lecture, but he is working on this for the next one! Lectures are not really related to the projects.

Despite all this, Max is a funny and really cool dude. I enjoy talking to him and hearing his thoughts and stories. It's obvious he's working to improve. I appreciate he has industry experience, which he ties to what we're learning!

My recommendations for improvement: 
- Organize lectures with clear explanations of each data science technique, use cases, and relevant examples. 
- Create more organized hand written notes that can serve as a reference. 
- Review key concepts necessary for projects and exams.
- Keep sharing cool stories and industry insights!",2,A,2022-11-10T00:27:45.065723Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Everyone who gave him a 5 star review doesn't understand that just by curving an exam by 30% makes you a better professor. His lectures are still uninteresting, he goes on niche tangents with 3 kids in the class that make lecture an unbearable nightmare where you don't learn anything. I'm willing to bet that the 3 people who gave him those 5 star reviews are the same people who sit front of the class asking him questions to get him to go on random tangents for 90 minutes.",1,A,2022-11-10T00:57:54.400526Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,Really nice guy passionate about data science. Not a good teacher. If you want to self-teach yourself all of the content in this course then take Maks. His lectures are hard to follow as they involve at least 3 tangents minimum. He is not organized and it is very unclear on how much we need to know about mentioned topics. This makes studying almost impossible. I only did well on the first exam due to prior knowledge and google. I would recommend taking this class with someone else and make your life easier.,1,A+,2022-11-10T23:46:14.584872Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Take it with someone else if you actually want to learn something. He's a nice guy, but doesn't really teach anything substantial that's useful for the projects and exams. He talks about various topics at a very surface level but doesn't go into any of the details. The first exam was just STAT 400 questions and student-made questions from Piazza. Also the things we were tested on he didn't really go into much detail in in lecture. Only thing that I have found valuable from this class so far are the projects created by previous professors for the course.",1,A,2022-11-12T00:24:42.136849Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Professor Max is a super down to earth dude. I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. 

The way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. 

Projects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don’t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn’t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don’t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it’s just how it is unfortunately 

Exam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it’s only really bad if the professor isn’t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn’t even a big deal

Lectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn’t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you’re a geek that doesn’t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn’t for you. 

Overall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. 

Other ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I’m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn’t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn’t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that’s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you’ll like Max. If you’re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.

Conclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit",5,B,2022-11-12T11:32:52.662848Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience. Max shares his work stories about projects he did and how he did them, which is a lot more valuable to me then just coursework

Max is a breath of fresh air in the sea of super boring work heavy CMSC courses, love the dude

This is his first semester teaching the course and he is very gracious with curves and listens to student concerns. Super down to earth dude. Some technical difficulties in the class but he’s working on them 

Overall: he a little confused be he got the spirit",5,B,2022-11-12T20:55:01.032636Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Has a super fun personality. Unfortunately, this personality also involves him being incredibly hand-wavy for just about every topic, making it impossible to do the projects or the exams without literally learning all of the details and processes (which are deemed uncool) yourself. This is made more difficult by the fact that he's thrown out all of the previous relatively well-structured course material, replacing it with his free-form, tangent-filled lectures, with no useful slides or notes posted. 

Logistics is a nightmare. Completely unreliable and disorganized. Difficult to get in touch with and has yet to timely follow through (if at all) on a single assurance he's made all semester when you do. Hasn't bothered to figure out the most basic software used for the course, making things even worse for students in every way (exams, projects, recordings, notes, slides).

Even if we end up with an insane curve to make up for his incompetence (which seems to be the case from the first exam), we've been taught little in a potentially fascinating course and have been enormously stressed and frustrated.",1,B+,2022-11-13T07:50:29.054960Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Horrible teacher. He fails at not only teaching but also responding to relevant questions. His lectures are more about his personal life than it is about data science, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time by even attending the lectures. The fact that he had to curve an exam by >30% in a class that's not even meant to be difficult speaks volumes. As much as I'd like to say he's a good person but bad professor, I'm afraid to say an irresponsible professor is not exactly the best person.

If you're reading this, kindly teach relevant information. As much as some members of the class enjoy your tangents, I (and many others) came here to learn and nothing else. Please teach in a practical and planned manner. I loathe those who are fortunate enough to not value over 90 minutes of time.

To reiterate, if you are reading this: Students come here to learn data science. You are obviously a talented and tested individual, and clearly possess the capability of teaching. I can only assume you think we don't take this course seriously, and therefore neither should you.",1,A,2022-11-13T08:14:53.062387Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Absolutely horrid professor and class. If you take this class get prepared to teach yourself all the material related to any assignment or quiz. He has no comprehension of what it's like to be a student in his class where he handwaves every topic briefly with no reinforcement and then assigns us projects where it is NOT RELATED AT ALL to what he is teaching. He is more concerned with his job at EBay than he is with actually being a good professor and to compensate for this just showers the class in extra credit (which does not make him a better professor). Overall, horrible professor. If you enjoy learning any actual material don't take a class with him. You will regret it.",1,W,2022-11-14T19:04:47.952638Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"READ! This semester was his first time teaching and he caused a blunder with the midterm, which wasn't even that bad in my opinion. That's the only reason a bunch of nutcases spammed him with 1-star reviews. Anyway, he curved very reasonably and is set on not repeating his mistake. Aside from this, he consistently enlightens us about the Data Science industry and teaches us useful concepts relevant to the industry. His lectures are fun to go to! Additionally, he listens. He's always asking for feedback and genuinely feels bad for the mistakes he has caused. You study for exams (both online) by following a well-written study guide he provides. Regarding projects, they are also fun and you learn applicable Data Science skills. There's no final exam, but instead, a final project where you can make what you want to while fulfilling certain requirements. Max is super lenient with your ideas and is super easy to talk to. If you're uneasy because of his reviews, just go talk to him and decide for yourself.",5,A+,2022-11-15T03:19:02.930628Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Honestly, ignore the 1-star reviews. He has a 5 star on ratemyprofessor out of 30 ratings. It's from UMBC and it's the same Max, I checked his LinkedIn. I can guarantee the 1-star reviewers are all nerds.

Max is hilarious, makes lectures fun, and teaches valuable course material. People are mad because ""what he says in lecture doesn't help us with the projects"", yea, it doesn't. That is a common occurrence for higher-level CMSC courses. I guess none of those reviewers have gotten past CMSC351/CMSC330 yet.  Projects involve using code to extract text from websites, organizing it, and making graphs/visualizations out of the data to make a point. Do people actually expect Max to stand there for 90 minutes every lecture teaching us how to code in pandas? He showed us the basics then everything else builds on that. Making a pretty visualization is something google helps you with. I do think Max should provide us with documents with code examples relevant to the projects outside of lecture, which is something he currently does not do, otherwise I don't mind his teaching.

Max also uses his experience from working in the field to teach us and explain what is and is not relevant. I love knowing what topics are actually used in the field because I want to work in data science. Knowing what to expect means I can focus on certain topics more and do better on interviews. Everyone that is roasting Max for talking about his work in the field is an absolute donut that just wants to be spoon-fed code instead of learning topics at a high level and figuring out the code on their own. 

Max is also a very considerate and reasonable instructor that understands that students have a life outside of his class and is willing to accommodate for special circumstances. Very down to earth and likable dude",5,B+,2022-11-19T05:07:36.690991Z

Nice guy, would love to get a beer with him some time but the course is so disorganized to the point where it makes learning horrible. He was adamant on changing the slides in the beginning of the year because they ""weren't good"" and now instead teaches off whatever tangents his brain works off of. I can't imagine how Jose feels as he recently revamped the course just to have it ruined by Max.

Other than that, he's a cool guy and completely understanding/willing to take feedback. The 1-star reviewers are all crybaby's and think everything they need to know for this class needs to be spoon-fed to them like a little child. People even tried to take advantage of his kindness claiming the stat questions on the midterm shouldn't count because STAT400 isn't a prerequisite for this class.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Ill break it down for everyone as best as I can.
Cons: 
- No lecture slides
- He has lecture notes he wrote, but only sometimes do they get posted
- The first midterm was a mess. He put a huge curve on it to make up for it though. 
- Not many code examples
Pros: 
- Relatable nerdy guy with stories from the industry (he is not a professional professor, he is data scientist with an insanly good resume) 
- Willing to do better as a professor, the first exam was a mess, the second one was not. If someone did bad on the second exam it was probably because they did nothing all semester. 
- Gives warm-up questions at the start of lectures which he describes as interview problems 

All in all, he is not the worst professor. The projects are related to the materials despite what some other peoples reviews are saying. The exam questions were related to the lectures, despite what some other reviews are saying. Do the projects require a lot of Googling? Yes, they do. There were not too many code examples given in the course but the documentation surronding what you are doing is actually really good. So, having to Google it, is not like shooting yourself in the foot. 

I'd say 4/5. There is room for improvement, but it could of been way worse. 

I found it was best to skip the in-person lecture as watching the recording of the lecture made taking notes easier as the lectures are actually him just talking to you and not reading off a slide show.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max gave very interesting lectures and is a great presenter and I feel like I learned a lot in the course. He has a lot of experience in the field so he makes sure to focus on the things that people will need to be successful in their careers. He also gave lectures on important skills that aren't taught in Computer Science like ethics and how to talk to people. He makes the class feel like a safe space for everyone and is very accommodating.

His first test was very disorganized but he gave lots of extra credit to make up for it and worked things out with people who had problems on top of that. The second test was a lot better and he still let people talk him into extra credit for certain questions. The final project is one that will look good to employers and replaces any final test. There are 4 projects in the class that can take a bit of time to complete if you don't understand the tools but once you know how to use the them the projects don't take long at all. Overall, I highly recommend taking this class with him.",5,A+,2022-12-12T22:24:52.487608Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Maks is a fun lecturer, as a data scientist who had worked in the industry he shared a lot of interesting stories relating to his experience with past jobs. However the class itself is disorganized, you have to rely heavily on the notes you take during class as he doesn't consistently have official class notes, and the exams didn't have any official practice questions other than student-made ones posted on Piazza. The projects rely heavily on your ability to google the right things as there's not much in the lectures dedicated on teaching students how to use Python other than a few mentions of some random Python methods here and there.
As this is his first semester teaching here he is willing to improve, he does listen to students' feedback. His second exam was much more fair and comprehensive compared to his first exam.",4,B+,2022-12-13T18:51:14.984925Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"So here's the thing - I don't think the 1-star grades are fair. Maks first and foremost is a genuinely nice person - this goes a long way. The only real issue with the class is the material covered in class is pretty orthogonal to the exams from what I understand

320 also has a reputation of being a very chill class so the departure from this I think makes a lot the ratings (unfairly in some sense) lower - he's a new professor and I truly think he wants everyone to do well.
Also just wanted to point out that the claim in an earlier review that the class material not corresponding with the tests/projects is common in upper level classes is completely wrong. I've taken 6 or 7 (I can't remember) 400 level CS courses - this has never been the case. 

I generally agree with the review left on 12/06/22",3,A+,2022-12-13T22:55:04.638493Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"This class started off very disorganized, as Max restructured the entire course curriculum. He taught what he thought was useful, and gave lots of stories about his time in industry and was clearly very experienced in the field. The big knock was that exam 1 was poorly structured, and even though I didn't agree and thought it was fine, he gave such a big curve that my 77% became a 110%. Projects were admittedly unrelated to most course content, but there was an emphasis on trying to learn how to Google, and they were easily manageable. Overall, nice professor and good class.",4,A,2022-12-13T23:02:18.554460Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"This is Max's first semester and I definitely think he will improve as a professor, however I feel like I did not get as much out of this class as I had hoped. He doesn't really have any lecture notes, so sometimes it is hard to follow and know what is and isn't important in lecture. The only exam practice that is given are practice problems created by other students in the class, which is nice practice but gives you no direction about what you actually need to know for exams. He does curve exams pretty generously. He rarely answers Piazza posts, which can be pretty frustrating especially when questions that are asked days before projects are due are never answered. I feel like what we learn in class isn't super helpful with the projects, and I usually spend more time googling than I do coding. It's not too difficult to do well in this class, but unfortunately I don't feel like I have learned a ton. Outside of teaching, Max is a very nice guy and I can tell he genuinely wants everyone to do well in his class, and I think his classes will definitely get better after he gets more practice as a professor.",3,A,2022-12-16T20:25:21.122730Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,Good lectures. Reasonable grading.,5,,2022-12-22T04:05:59.529907Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He definitely cares about his students and makes the effort to answer questions and improve our understanding of whatever he's lecturing. That being said, here are some general points about his class:
- He redid the CMSC320 curriculum in the beginning of the semester, but relevant lecture slides/notes and recordings sometimes weren't posted until weeks later 
- Projects and class material didn't really line up 
- The first exam had a really low average which led Maks to curve our grades (by a LOT). Second exam went by much better. We also had an opportunity for extra credit for each exam (posting an exam question on Piazza).
- No real practice exams or questions (outside of the questions posted for extra credit)
- He has prior knowledge working as a Data Scientist for places like Google and Ebay and tells us about his experiences there
- Grading is kind of slow -- 2/4 of the mini-projects still aren't graded (and one was turned in around a month ago)
- Googling is an important skill to have
- Maks is open to feedback, willing to improve, answers questions, will offer advice and ways to improve, and cares about his students

This was his first semester here though, and I definitely see things with him improving next semester.",4,A-,2022-12-22T15:19:41.929995Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Will be good in 2-3 semesters. But for now he remains disorganized and uncoordinated with the material he teaches in lecture and what he expects from projects and exams.

Very reasonable guy however and generous curve was given for any mistakes. Once he figures out things I imagine he’ll be a great addition to the department.",3,,2022-12-24T18:23:47.184737Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Disorganized course admittedly. However, he's a really nice guy and has definitely been trying his best. The biggest thing is that he's always willing to make up for things he's made mistakes with. He curved generously when the exams went (on average) poorly. I did abysmally on the first exam (failed it even after a 15% curve), because the class is harder with Max than it seems to have been with some other professors. The final project was interesting and topic selection was lenient (although grades took a while). I ended up with needing about 0.01% to get an A- and I emailed Max asking if he would round me up. He graciously rounded me all the way to an A (approximately a 3-4% bump iirc). 

Ultimately, you shouldn't *not* take a class because it's with Max. Even if you feel like you don't know what's going on during the class, your grade will reflect your understanding as relative to your peers. Give him a shot, sit in the front of the class, and you'll like him.",5,A,2023-01-06T16:29:59.332532Z

Exams could be somewhat challenging, so I recommend you find study groups and follow his study guides he releases. Like any CS course, most of my learning is from Googling and stackoverflow, so I can't really hate on him. He was lenient in the projects being turned in (we had an extra day for like 3 of them).

Some issues did come up, but this was his first time teaching, some mistakes are expected. He also made sure that his mistakes didn't screw over students giving VERY generous curves on exams when they did happen (many of the negative reviews came immediately after the exam, before he announced the curve). For a normal exam with no mistakes, they can be pretty difficult but he also curves it up to an average of 75%. Overall I'd recommend this professor, I genuinely enjoyed his class and he's good at teaching imho. Giving 4 stars for the the mistakes, but I have no doubt that he could get 5 easily. Definitely one of the best CS professors at UMD. For reference, I'd personally put him next to Nelson and Jose Cauldron in ranking.",4,A-,2023-02-09T20:56:10.343456Z

Class is terribly organized because he himself seems a little disorganized but mainly because he cotaught 351 with Kruskal, whose class is always a mess. His lectures are pretty disorganized but if you pay attention to what he says he gives very very very helpful advice, but you have to listen to what he is saying. There weren't any slides which sucks. Averages on the Kruskal written exams were like in the mid to low 60s, but gave strong curves obviously. Great man, improving professor with lots of potential. CMSC 351 is made unnecessarily difficult when its Kruskals course. Not his fault for the class being bad.",4,,2023-05-11T03:20:07.567333Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"i've never had a teacher more open to feedback and thoughts than him. honestly the class kinda sucked but he clearly cares about the students and what their opinions are on everything going on. he always seems to try and do his best to figure out how to make us feel better and have a good experience in class (even tho again, class sucked but like hes a nice fella). it's a good enough reason alone to take him just cuz of how nice he is. he also curves very generously because of how aware he is that this class kinda sucks. 
his lectures felt pretty all over the place. he's a very engaging speaker and tries to make the class interactive so you wont be bored and your brain will be moving during it but most people i know and i primarily learned from kruskal's videos rather than maks' class just because of how messy it'd be sometimes. he'd get terms/content wrong and correct himself a lecture later, change up variables, explain things incorrectly, etc. it's probably just cuz he just started teaching here tho, he'll probably have  a much better grasp of the content and how to teach it by like a semester or two. it definitely felt like he didn't rehearse or think much abt how to convey new information, but again, he'll probably be good with time.  
honestly more of a 3.5/5 stars with my specific experience in this course but he'll def be like a 4 or 5 in a few semesters. i rounded up since he's jus a nice guy lol some people on here are too mean. pretty sure he reads these too",4,,2023-05-11T05:00:56.351623Z

His lectures didn't prepare us for Kruskal's midterms or homeworks, but then again, Kruskal is really specific in what he wants (I still do not understand why we had to know how to calculate the exact number of comparisons for each algorithm) and I doubt anyone can really teach 351 at the level Dr Kruskal does. It also takes WAY too long to get a homework back (they've actually got 320 TAs grading 351). Overall though, I think Max tried really hard, and he's giving us a generous curve, and he's still new.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Co-taught with kruskal, so I'll ignore many of the issues that come with his content

Pros:
- Super caring about students. He recognized that Kruskal runs a brutal class, and heavily curved and gave us hints for exams to make up for it
- He cares heavily about his assignments and their grades accurately reflecting the knowledge of his students. Since Kruskal's content doesn't do that, he put a lot of effort into making sure nobody failed the class unless they were extremely under the average. He went as far as to curve the average for the entire class up to an A at the end.

Cons:
- Severe lack of knowledge of the subject. Everything I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures
- Very disorganized. Didn't prepare for lectures, and basically tried to learn the content along with us

Definitely has potential to be an excellent professor when he makes his own content and lectures about stuff he knows about. Unfortunately, this semester was neither. I'm giving him a 4/5 for his extreme willingness to de-Kruskal the class by any means necessary.",4,A,2023-05-17T16:29:24.318955Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I wanna cut Maks some slack. It was his first semester co-teaching 351 with Dr. Kruskal.
Overall, it seemed that he didn't have much control over the course structure/material since it was his first time teaching. All decisions were ultimately up to Dr. Kruskal. 
I don't know the extent that Maks had over the HWs and Exams that were given to us. They all felt as though they were made by Dr. Kruskal.
The HWs and exams were insanely challenging. Averages for both midterms seemed to be around ~60%.

During lectures he taught us based on Dr. Kruskal's recorded lectures from previous semesters. Maks' lectures were very high-level though, so I still had to watch Dr.Kruskals lecture videos to know the full extent of the material and all the deeper math theory behind specific algorithms.

Hopefully, I can make it through this course with a passing grade. As of right now, right after our final, nobody can tell what their grades will be.
Maks has potential to be great though! He genuinely cares about his students and relates to us. So he understands the struggles and stress everybody went through this semester. I'm excited to see how he ends up structuring his course for semesters to come. He has the same teaching knowledge as Dr. Kruskal now, so he might be continuing the same curriculum but in his own revised way. Which I can say is definitely useful and important to know! I can definintely say I'm coming out of this course knowing the deeper math fundamentals behind algorithms. So take it with him if you want to learn a lot!",4,P,2023-05-17T21:22:22.779626Z

Yes, he's a new teacher and has a lot of fine-tuning to do, but he does listen to student feedback and tries to accommodate student needs as much as possible if you just talk to him. For this course especially, it's easy to tell that he did not have much control over the course since he was co-teaching with kruskal, so a lot of the course's clumsiness can be attributed to that. But he's a much-needed breath of sympathetic fresh air in the CS department, and it's clear he cares a lot about the well-being of his students. He has everything he needs to become a great professor, just give the lad some time. And while he's still figuring things out he's never blamed his students for any resulting grade discrepancies and reassesses accordingly. I really don't think there's much more you can ask for, especially for his first semester teaching the course and having to coteach w kruskal.",4,,2023-05-18T16:16:32.087983Z

The exams are very open ended, sometimes weirdly or vaguely worded, and generally just harder then they should be. The class material only really prepares you for the exams if his exact way of teaching works for you, and for most people it doesn't. Everything else in the class is graded very generously though.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is definitely not your standard CS professor, but do yourself a favor and take him anyways. You’ll leave this class feeling like you have a better understanding of what data science actually is, rather than a random assortment of knowledge that you have to regurgitate on exams to get an A(which is what a lot of CS classes are). On top of that, I’m almost certain he’s the nicest person in this department. He’s very understanding of the fact that we’re all stressed out college students, so he’s chill with deadlines as long as you reach out to him. He’s also a huge nerd and is incredibly funny. I found myself laughing constantly throughout his lectures(go to lecture, they’re fun). Also, go to his office hours or set up a meeting with him. This man has a lot of experience in industry, he’s well connected, and he’s a very approachable guy who wants to help everyone be the best version of themselves. You’re missing out if you don’t talk to him.
He’s not perfect. He sometimes makes promises he doesn’t keep, he doesn’t really have practice questions for exams, and it often seems like he put the lecture together the night before and hoped for the best. BUT he made up for everything and was willing to change his course policy any time we had an issue with something. 
TLDR: take him if you want a friendly professor who cares about you and wants you to be a competent person in industry. Don’t take him if you want a super structured, math-heavy course.",4,A,2023-05-22T23:24:13.375303Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"An interesting, caring, and potentially great professor. This was his first semester teaching CMSC351, and he was co-teaching with Kruskal; so the semester was, as expected, brutal. However, he did genuinely try his best to accommodate the students.
Pros:
- Incredibly welcoming and lovely person: if you want advice, talk to someone openly, or review lecture contents, then come to his office. 
- Engaging and interactive: the lectures became more interesting (but it was a bit time-consuming, so he might not go over everything he needed to teach and told us to watch Kruskal's lectures)
- Understanding: Max curves the final grade generously, especially if you show efforts, such as coming to office hours for help consistently or showing up to class and participating in lectures, then he will most likely bump up your missing 1%.
Cons:
- Disorganized. Most of the contents I learned from this class were from Kruskal's videos and online resources. I hope Max could become more familiar with the topics over the summer and incorporate a structured approach to teaching in the future. For example, Max, if you're reading this, it would be helpful to have slides containing important notes for the class. While it's great to work through examples during the lecture, including them in the slides would save time (color-coded and animated). It would be ideal if the slides could be shared before or after the lecture.
- Exams. Just terrifying. Well, it's not Max's fault because Kruskal wrote them, but my midterms haunted me. 
- Grading. It was really slow this semester due to the complications with the TAs; but it will improve, hopefully.
Advices:
- If Kruskal is going to write the exams for Max's classes, then study the homework religiously. There were practice exams, but not really helpful. You should still do it for extra practices, but mostly focus on the homework of all the topics that would appear on the exam. 
- Go to office hours. The schedule needs improvement, but it's helpful.
- Study group. Yep! Teach each other and review together.",5,B,2023-05-25T23:43:08.634085Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Honestly it's kinda hard for me to fairly review Max given the class was co-taught with Kruskal but I'm doing it regardless to help people who may consider taking him.

Max is very genuine, caring and makes lectures engaging but his knowledge was shaky (for 351 at least).  His curves are also very generous so if you're interested in getting a good grade, having a nice professor, and don't want lectures to be boring you may like him. If you want to learn at a very deep level and don't mind sacrificing a good grade, Kruskal is for you. The class in general was very unorganized but both Max and Kruskal have that sort of history but unlike Kruskal, Max is new and seeking to improve. 

Down the line I can definitely see Max being one of the more favored professors but I think he is just having a rough start since he is still new.

There were a lot of people who got 50s and also people who got 100s on the second exam which clearly shows it was a horribly made exam. The second midterm was also right before classes ended making the final seem pointless. His lectures are bad but instead of improving them, he tells you to watch videos and read articles if you want to learn the material. His review sheets that he makes during class are scarily organized and a majority of the stuff he said was gonna be on the exam was not there, making it hard to trust the review sheets at all.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"351 with Max was a beautiful disaster. 

First, the review of the class: Max co-taught with Kruskal since this was his first semester teaching 351. As a result, we got all of Kruskal’s exams and homework assignments which are notoriously difficult. Max did not have control over what was being taught and the difficulty of assessments since Kruskal was in charge, and as a result, he sometimes stumbled over content (it’s hard to keep up with a mad scientist). It honestly seems like Kruskal and Max hate each other (understandably so) since there was a lot of miscommunication throughout the semester. To pass this class, this is what I did: I showed up to Max’s lecture with the expectation of getting a simplified overview. I did have to supplement the content to keep up: Kruskal has pre-recorded videos that go into the content in depth, and I binge watched those videos and reviewed the homework’s a few days before the exams. The exams feel similar to the homework assignments, but at the same time they are different, so it felt like a big wildcard, and I found it better to just YOLO the exams than to stress about them. My mantra: take inspiration from the homework assignments and express your creativity on the exams. I had no idea what I was doing on any of the exams, but try to grab the “easy” points and think on your feet. 

Max as a lecturer: he’s naturally charismatic and has a geeky sense of humor. I feel like he genuinely wants the class to pass. Even though at times Max was confused, at least he was enthusiastic while being confused? He would drop hints about the exam topics during the review which was helpful to dial in on, and his encouragement to keep us going while we were all flopping was helpful. At the end of the semester, his cutoffs were a lot more generous than Kruskal’s. For example, Kruskal’s version of an A- was an 80.5% while Max’s version of an A- was 69%. 

TLDR: if Max ever teaches 351 with Kruskal again, take it with Max and hang on for dear life.",5,A-,2023-05-28T18:30:51.198350Z

This was not worth the hours of stress that this class put me through (especially the final) because the exam structure itself was impossible (Kruskal said the average should be around 65%) and the major delay in grades. This saying this course is mainly a rant against the way Kruskal structured it, Max didn't have much say over the structure or content. He gave us a large curve, but this also was probably the worst class I've taken with the CS department (but its because of Kruskal not Max). In conclusion, Kruskal is the villain and Max was forced to join the dark side.",3,B-,2023-05-29T01:05:15.660070Z

Max was forced to co-teach with Kruskal, in which Max was not very happy with as far as I know, because Max had little to no control over the material. Kruskal and Max were both discontent at each other, because Max didn't want to follow what Kruskal does.

I think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you really understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last ""coding interview"" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode medium without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these ""interview"" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing you whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.

Now, onto Max. Like I said, Max wanted to go with Justin's material to teach his class, so him being forced to follow Kruskal's material was probably stressful for him. I'll give him credit for trying his best. He's definitely someone who wants his students to pass the class, although that is not evident in his teaching, but in the curve. He gave a lot more substantial curve than Kruskal's even when Kruskal's curve was pretty large, which was about one letter grade difference, although the pass/fail cutoff was comparable for both of them. Does Max teach well? Well, that's another matter.

I think the problem with Max is that he severely lacks knowledge on the material. It's not that Kruskal's material is different from Justin's or whatever, he just doesn't know the subject well enough to lecture it. I'm sure Max is very competent when it comes to an actual practice as an engineer given his career, but I think his teaching is very shallow, although he has potential to improve. I definitely think Max wants to become the next Justin, someone who is approachable to his students, explains the concepts well, and have the majority of his students get an A. The thing is, I barely learned anything from Max's lectures. Pretty much the entire knowledge I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures and his office hours. The difference in the level of quality in answers you get from Kruskal's office hours and Max's office hours is pretty significant. I definitely think that Max will improve a lot, but I can't say that I learned a lot from him.

Despite the co-teaching, there is a pretty huge difference in the philosophy of teaching 351 between Kruskal and Max. Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. The way Max seemingly wanted to run this class is like a standard class, where you just take notes and you can do well on the exam just from the rote memorization. The difference in the philosophy of the subject is probably why Max and Kruskal were so unhappy with each other. I personally think that critical thinking and understanding is much more crucial rather than simple regurgitation when it comes to algorithm and theory. This is probably why I learned a lot more from Kruskal and give him more credit than Max. But I think Max has a lot of potential and I definitely do see Max as a good lecturer in a few years.

One thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured and Max did his best for his first semester teaching it. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools, so I can definitely feel Max's frustration in having to be forced to teach that way only. But then again, the whole CS curriculum at UMD needs some fixing.",3,A+,2023-05-29T09:35:11.381315Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Absolutely would not recommend class with him. His projects were fair and doable, but lectures and exams were horrible. The class was so unorganized, exams were horribly made and had very low averages. The second midterm was also right before classes ended making the final seem pointless. He seemed to acknowledge what was wrong or that the results were bad but then just kind of moved on.  His lectures are bad but instead of improving them, he tells you to watch videos and read articles. His review sheets that he makes during class are scarily organized and a majority of the stuff he said was gonna be on the exam was not there, making it hard to trust the review sheets at all. Overall, would not recommend this class with him.",1,,2023-05-30T21:59:19.620510Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"So I had Max for 320 last semester. I wrote a Piazza post 3/4 of the way through the semester, discussing the lack of organization, lack of resources, and how the exams were just bad. Majority of the class agreed to that post and he said he would address the feedback. He mentioned he would have dropped the final exam, but he didn't want to change the syllabus. He also did mention he would also drop the final for the following semester, especially since it would be redundant along with a final project. From what I hear, he did not do so. I would avoid Max and wait for a professor who can support students through the learning process rather than throwing the kitchen sink at them and seeing what sticks.",1,,2023-09-07T14:17:44.552220Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC106,"Maks is really nice and it's obvious that he is on our side, and knows how difficult the course is. His lectures are good and he posts the material afterwards which is helpful, however since the class is naturally difficult and hard to keep up with you should make sure you practice a lot on your own time to ensure you do good.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Although this was Max's first semester teaching CMSC250, I can't recommend him in good conscience. Lectures are highly disorganized. He frequently shows up with mistakes in his prepared materials and makes several errors in most proofs that he attempts in class. The first midterm was ridiculously long and ended up with a 70-average and he only provided a curve after many students wrote several paragraph long requests via Piazza. Grading is a nightmare. We have a weekly problem set (which I believe are written by the TAs) which are often filled with unclear questions and/or typos. These problem sets take the instructors weeks, and sometimes months, to grade. On both midterms, we were tested on concepts that we had never actually been graded on yet since we were still waiting to get our submissions back. I fear this may be the case on our upcoming final exam too. He's also bad at replying to emails in a timely manner. Also, I don't think he gives good instructions to TAs since their responses on Piazza are very short, abrupt, and sometimes teeter on rude.",1,A,2023-12-09T19:07:49.306920Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Easily my favorite professor I've had at umd, and made me want to go into data science. The class is a bit disorganized, but exams and homework are pretty fair. Max has the only lecture that I actually looked forward to attending, he has so much knowledge to share about the actual industry (he's worked at google, ebay, etc), he's super chill and understanding of students, and a super entertaining dude. Can't speak for any of his other classes but 100% recommend taking 320 with him, class has been pretty easy. Definitely goat potential",5,A-,2023-12-11T23:12:04.925087Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is a nice guy with decent career advice and industry knowledge and that's about it when it comes to his teaching. While his projects were insanely easy, they in no way prepared you for his exams. He expects people to have a deep understanding of the content but doesn't realize that to get to that point of deep understanding you need quality practice material and assignments that build up your knowledge. The lectures are incredibly surface level and showing up to class is a big waste of time, I found it hard to separate the word vomit/tangents from the important content. I didn't feel like I learned much in this class besides how to Google. Overall, I would recommend taking a different professor.",1,A-,2023-12-14T06:27:25.194132Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Honestly, Max is not too bad as a professor. I have to admit that he wasn't my first choice for 250 because Kline was rated better, but I had to take him because of course conflicts. 
Take him. It's a easy course. Most of it is common sense. Sure, you'll be introduced to new stuff, but with Max it was pretty easy as a course. I saw my friends struggle with Telli and Kline, but I studied for about 7 hrs before each of Max's exams(including the final) and I did pretty well on all of them. Homeworks are graded extensively and we have discussion worksheets that are graded which I didn't love but overall he's fine.

Rocky start, but he's been learning to teach better and get more organized (in the first few classes he didn't even get the name of the course right) but now he makes powerpoints and goes over everything; it's good enough honestly. Make sure to read Justin's notes which are online because his whole structure was based on it. Good luck!",4,A,2023-12-14T23:20:32.056176Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max is understanding and approachable, but I don't know if I would suggest taking one of his classes (or at least this class) based on his teaching style. Throughout the semester lectures were disorganized (got a little bit better towards the end, but still weren't great), and he would sometimes leave gaps in the steps of a problem/not do some problems since they were ""too annoying"" (but we would have to know how to do them). This semester, the class weights were 40% homework, 10% lab worksheets, 30% midterms (2 midterms), and 20% final. The homework problems were difficult, but you were able to get most done on your own (you have at least a week to do each of them) and if you had any questions about any of the problems you could go to office hours and the TAs would help you understand them better. The worksheets were every Wednesday and they were done in discussion (some TAs would go over how to do the problems, but mine didn't) and they were graded on completion. The midterms were fine for the most part, but on both midterms, there was a problem where very few people got them completely right (e.g only 5-10% of people got full credit for them) so your exam grade basically dropped a letter grade just from that one problem (on the first midterm that problem ended up getting dropped, but it was a special circumstance). Max also taught using Justin's notes (so you could have chosen to not attend lectures). 

I feel like the class would have been a lot better if Max learned the material ahead of time and planned the course in a way that would work for him (instead of using Justin's notes, there are pros and cons to not using Justin's notes though). I felt like he was learning the material/what he was teaching the day of or the night before the lecture because he often made mistakes when explaining/doing the problems in the lecture. I also felt like the class was being run by the TAs and Max (and this isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it felt like the TAs would tell him often what to do and what not to do.

I was going to give Max a higher rating, but the following reasons are why I didn't. The final was more challenging than the midterms and I would almost go as far as saying that some of the problems on the final were as hard as the homework problems. I also felt like there was a problem on the final that was just straight-up, not possible (maybe it's a skill issue, but it didn't seem possible to do based on what the question was asking). This leads me to another issue that I have with the class. Almost all homework assignments/review sheets that we had in the class had typos which is frustrating (since some problems are either impossible/completely different even with a slight change in wording). I will say that most typos were noticed and fixed quickly, but I don't think it should happen that often (this is a red flag for me because if typos happen that often are they reading/doing the problems beforehand?).

Max is a 10/10 person, but a 3/10 teacher in my opinion.",2,A-,2023-12-16T01:24:29.071328Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Class is just a mess. Grading takes forever (Homework due late October still is not back yet) and Prof. Morawski doesn't seem to really care about that. Our final project was released extremely late and last homework was also released really late. Barely any communication about this. The last homework was released so late that we were basically expected to work on it over Thanksgiving break, when it was originally supposed to be due 2 weeks before break. None of the homework is that hard (IMO at least) but it's just annoying that you continuously have to check up to see if the professor has even released the homeworks when he's already behind schedule. 

Prof. Morawski also is just bad at teaching, plain and simple. Lectures seemed more like a stand up routine to him. As other reviewers said, the slides have minimal info, and equations are often wrong. There's no clear definitions for anything, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everything is taught in an example/high level way but you are expected to understand and replicate at a low detailed level. For example, with hypothesis tests, you will not find detailed definitions in the slides that include everything he wants you to know. You have to google these things or use the other prof's slides. This is kind of insane to me as Prof. Morawski has taught this class MULTIPLE times before. And, you can tell that he thinks his teaching style is superior to other professors, which is frankly hilarious as he also goes on about how he thinks he didn't explain things well or how the exams he wrote/gave us are bad exams.

Homeworks and projects always needed numerous corrections-- again, kind of ridiculous for a professor who has taught this class before. Good luck starting the homework early, because he will probably change multiple things in the first few days of homework release. 

Exams had questions where you were supposed to use your ""real world brain"" and think outside the box. What does this actually mean? Trick questions and ones that are long/confusingly worded for no reason. We had some tricky questions on things that he *explicitly* did not teach us previously due to cancelling class multiple times or having the other prof teach us for a class. I understand that he had to cancel class for personal issues, but I didn't think it was fair to have tough questions on concepts that he himself did not teach us.

Anyway, all of the below reviews are very accurate as to how you will feel about Prof. Morawksi. You will either be mildly irritated at his lack of organization and general lecture style, or you will become part of his fan club. No in between. You will not feel neutral about him.",1,A-,2023-12-16T20:15:56.602513Z

Most of his lectures were incredibly unorganized, and his notes were never uploaded on time. He posted Justin's notes which helped a lot more than his own notes, so I guess that helped. There was very unclear communication between students and TAs about grades on homework and discussions, and most grades were entered after the exams that covered them. Fortunately I figured out most of the content on my own, but Max's lectures didn't really help much at all. I would try to take another professor if you could.",2,A,2023-12-18T02:32:54.689059Z

If you wanna take the easy way out take another major. If you go to class and PAY ATTENTION he shares useful information and knowledgeable insight to his experiences in the industry. My only complaint is his slides are pretty bad, but luckily he's coteaching with Fardina who has pretty excellent slides so as I study for the final I will be going off her slides. They are just more detailed. He should improve his slides because with just his slides it hard to know whats going on. If you care about learning and are interested in Data Science take Max.

The class final project was somewhat of an afterthought and was just a 15% of your grade homework tacked on the end of the semester. It was Doctor Fardina's first time teaching the course, yet she put together a much better experience over the semester (specifically the last two exams: much higher average score on midterm 2 and allowed a formula sheet on the final/was very clear about what topics to review).",1,B,2023-12-19T18:40:50.195141Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"TLDR: low-medium workload. Avoid him if you just want to get through 250 as painlessly as possible, take him if you don't mind dealing with a bit of BS for a fun and memorable professor. 
One common thread you'll see throughout Max's reviews is that the class is pretty disorganized, that held pretty true this semester too. He frequently made simple mistakes during lectures, had practice problems that were wrong or incomplete, and on occasion something on a homework or exam pops out way harder than it was supposed to. Grading speed was also a big issue, although the homeworks were much harder than the rest of the class/exams. I can see if you just want a straightforward professor who posts all their notes nice and neat, is consistent with teaching, and is generally predictable why you would not like Max. If, however, you commit to going to class and can deal with a little BS, you'll find him a very memorable professor who had the class bursting in applause for anything from getting basic arithmetic right to designating an entire exam problem extra credit. I genuinely enjoyed my time in the lecture, even through all the hiccups. If that's something you can see yourself doing, give him a try.",5,,2023-12-19T20:36:31.588882Z

This is my second course with Max, and the disorganization has definitely improved, but is still pretty bad. Regardless, it's clear that he LOVES this class, and he's incredibly knowledgeable on the subject (has industry experience at Google and some startups). Would definitely recommend if you can put up with the long wait time for grades to come in, and the generally disorganized course structure.",4,A,2023-12-22T16:35:20.998825Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max is pretty mediocre, but an entertaining guy and his class isn't difficult. His lectures are somewhat poorly structured and he frequently makes mistakes while lecturing. Occasionally he'll admit he's not well-versed in what he's teaching at the moment. He often changes course policies at the whims of the TAs, which can be frustrating as students never know exactly what to expect. Overall the class isn't run very well. 

Moving on to his positives, he gives out weekly homework which is great practice material but not too difficult. There are lots of helpful third-party resources given to students so it's hard to get lost or fall behind. The midterm exams were both fair and easy, and the first one was curved up significantly. The final was long and difficult but had a heavy curve, I personally got above a 100 after the curve. 

Max is fine. Take him if there aren't better options available. 250 isn't a hard class, but with Max you'll have to put in most of the effort yourself to succeed.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Overall, I think Max made data science my favorite course that I've taken here at UMD. There are still truths to some complaints here, but the positives are still far greater than the negatives and the way it's taught is so unique so I think people should still take this class with Max (or at least go to his 320 lectures when they happen, since they're quite interesting, humorous, and thought provoking).
First, the cons: Yes, the class was quite disorganized, we had an assignment due in October that wasn't graded until the last day of finals. Some problems were unclear or needed us to search up information on our own (but this research was very simple and not really an issue). He is unprepared sometimes; he mentioned some lectures went way faster than expected, or will forget to put something very important on slides, and also stopped posting recordings for lectures which made it a bit hard to study for exams. Additionally, he isn't the best at math, so he'll sometimes make mistakes on some slides or formulas, but in practice we hardly used formulas so this hardly disrupted the flow of the class. In terms of grades, the other section for Fall 2023 (with Fardina) was basically a guaranteed A (the average on Max's exams was about 77%, Fardina's average on exams was about 92%) so honestly, if grade is the [only] thing you care about, maybe you should take it with Fardina based on the stats.
But Max's section and thoughts have many positives: The overall grade for the regular assignments and final project (which were worth 55% of the class) was at 95% so no one really risked failing the class, and most of these took just around 2-4 hours to complete since there are lots of guides to do what was asked. Where Max really shines is in his lectures: they were the most consistently engaging ones that I've been through at the university, always getting people to ask questions, cracking jokes and being relatable on what being in CS is like. The way he teaches the course isn't just learning data science in how to design & execute an experiment, because he also notes where it's relevant and useful (he mentions how Goodhart's law is seen in practice through grade inflation, I wonder where this could be present...), what the industry currently uses in practice (how does Netflix or Amazon actually recommend things), and bringing his own industry experience to elaborate on what we would do working in data science. Additionally, he also goes on some important side tangents about other important topics, like critically thinking about what grades are, career advice and thinking about interviews, how to ingest ethics in practice, and other considerations in life that many other professors don't touch (he informally holds a group of people that learn more on these general life skills). In the end, the class is such a unique, refreshing, and positive experience that I'd advise everyone that can take 320 to take Max's section when he teaches it.",5,A,2023-12-23T17:24:34.998525Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I would not recommend him for this class at all. I had quite a bit of experience going into this class and as other reviews mention, it TRULY is disastrously organised. His slides were too minimal, and he would/could not explain concepts clearly (which he acknowledged) and then we'd be tested on minute details about those very concepts! His ""review guides"" would tell us we'd be tested on some topic, and that topic would never show up on the exam! He actually prides himself on his ""quirks"" but it's super annoying because it's too specific and not relevant. His office hours are also always filled with the same people chatting away so it's hard to ask him questions. I had him for 351 and I thought this course would be better but it's about the same. I don't think I learnt anything from him in either course.

He'll tell you cool stories about his time in the industry and that will usually be enough to distract you from the real problem that he doesn't know the content well enough to teach it. NEVER TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM!",1,B+,2023-12-24T02:12:21.423126Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I had Max for 320 this semester (Fall 2023) and 351 last semester (Spring 2023), and all I can say is that he is a great lecturer that genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed when they go to the industry. Many students complain that his slides are not comprehensive and that we need to google most concepts to better prepare for exams. However, I would argue that this reflects exactly what data scientists (and most CS related jobs) are doing in the industry. You are just required to have a basic understanding of class concepts, so googling stuff and learning the basics isn't really that bad. Max's style of teaching prepares the students to better navigate real-world challenges and to not be always ""spoon-fed"" with information.

Regarding the coursework, Max's exams are essentially about two things: Demonstrating basic understanding and extending the class ideas to real-world situations. I didn't study a lot for exam 1 and the final, and I got an A in both of them. If you hope that you will get an A by memorizing concepts and not actually understanding how the algorithms work and the math behind them (in a general/basic level), do not take the class with Max.  However, I must mention that Max sometimes messes up exams, where the average would be 70% or less. Though, you can always get partial credit and extra credit in all of his exams and assignments. Also, you can always email Max about anything, including bumping up your grade to the next cutoff if you think you deserve it! In general, Max's classes are easy, and you will do just fine if you attend lectures and demonstrate basic understanding in exams.",5,A,2023-12-24T23:48:40.957700Z

But the exams were EXTREMELY difficult! The average of Mid 02 was extremely low, and he was absent for some classes ( he is was sick though). He promised to curve that exam and ended up curving NOTHING! Before that, he openly admitted to us that it was unfair, and it felt like everyone was depending on it. Extremely disappointed, as the overall average for Fardina's section was so much higher than ours, and as heard from that section, she was very considerate to the students' needs. Everyone talked about how cool he is, but no one says the reality - how disorganized and less affectionate he could be.",3,A-,2023-12-26T05:36:19.817781Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,He is trying his best to reach Kruskal level. Do NOT take him as your professor. Anyone else would be better. He just gets worse and worse each semester (based on what I’ve read). Not a very understanding professor.,1,C,2023-12-26T19:34:29.323514Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"My opinion:
He is not that bad as some of the 1-star reviews state, and also not as good as some of the 5-star reviews. He taught the class in a way that was different from what one would expect. The subjects taught in class are very simplified, so students are encouraged to do outside research on what you learn in class. The projects were really fun for me as for some of them we were free do implement them how we wanted to. On the other hand, the exams were quite difficult and required us to expand on what we have learned in class to a large extent.",3,B+,2023-12-28T15:07:39.386039Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Don't get me wrong - he's a really nice and chill professor and takes his feedback into consideration. But, he is SO DISORGANIZED and that makes his lectures difficult to follow. He also seems unprepared coming during lecture and makes a handful of mistakes throughout. He came in once claiming how he had ""looked at these problems beforehand"" and ""knows how to solve them"" but as soon as he got stuck on one, he just skipped it with an ""ah whatever"" mentality. Also, his TAs (this semester) had a lot of attitude.....

Overall, it's not the end of the world if you get him as a professor, but just know that you'll have to put in a lot of effort.",3,A-,2023-12-28T16:07:51.791882Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The class with Max is generally straightforward, especially the programming assignments; the homework on SQL and Pandas borders on trivial, and the later assignments simply require using some Python libraries and can be completed with the help of a wealth of online tutorials. A couple assignments involve writing a report, and while they can be graded rather subjectively, it's simple enough to manage a decent grade on them with a few hours work. Our final project was released quite late, and thus was reasonably easy and minimal in time required.

The exams are designed to be open ended and make you display true conceptual understanding, as opposed to simply regurgitating material from the slides; it's not clear how effective this model was, as the averages on the first midterm were very high but were below a C for the second. Regardless, all the exams are doable if you really think about what Max is asking you to answer (rather than assuming what he is asking based on how a normal CS exam might go).

Max is prone to going on tangents while lecturing, keeping track of his idiosyncrasies can be annoying when trying to submit work that meets his standards, and his slides are wholly unhelpful; in spite of all of that, if you follow along in class and spend a few hours studying for the exams you'll be fine. I ended up enjoying Max's teaching style as a whole, even if it could sometimes be strange or frustrating. Recommend.",4,A,2023-12-31T08:33:25.172195Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Nice and supportive professor. Often asks for feedback and does listen to his students. This semester wasn't his best since this is his first time teaching and he had some health problems. But I believe he does have a lot of potential and will improve. Also, I would say he needs to do better at working with his TAs instead of letting them make the homeworks and discussion worksheets.",4,A,2024-01-04T02:25:12.917289Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max was an overall good professor. The start of the semester was incredibly rough as it was his first sem teaching the course and there was a lot of ambiguity as far as assignments went and what was expected of us in terms of proof structure and the detail to which we had to explain arguments. However, as the semester went on Max was very adamant about listening to feedback and implemented many of the suggestions we asked for, including extra credit and more detailed instructions for assignments. Overall he's a good professor who genuinely cares about his students and will listen to their suggestions.",4,A-,2024-01-19T17:26:26.572946Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He is a quirky guy who has his funny moments but at the end of the day, is a terrible instructor and comes off as incredibly arrogant and annoying. Yes, his lectures are engaging, but for all the wrong reasons. He rambles on about his work and personal experiences but ends up teaching very little substance as a result. He takes pride in his slides for being minimal, which isn't a problem by itself. But when you combine minimal slides containing useless information and formatting and an instructor who rambles on about pointless topics the whole lecture, then it becomes a problem. 

Exams are not fair. He tells us that to do well on exams we need to have a deep level of understanding of the material and to think outside of the box, which again, isn't a problem by itself. But he never gives us practice material to achieve that, as the homeworks are super straightforward and generally unrelated in concepts to exams, and doesn't teach properly enough to expect that from us. This is evident from our exam 2 average, which was 69 percent. Comparing that to Fardina's class (the instructor he was co-teaching with), which was 86 percent, it becomes comically unfair. He also never curved because of that exam even though he said he would. He said he instead ""compensated"" by making the final a bit easier, which is funny because our final exam average was still low at 82 percent compared to Fardina's 96 percent. 

At least CMSC320 isn't too difficult conceptually, with much higher weightage on homework, and less on exams, allowing many students, including me, to barely manage to get a good grade. I just feel really bad for people who were stuck with him for CMSC250 and/or will be for CMSC351, because those are objectively two of the most conceptually difficult CS classes students will take, with high weightage on exams, and Max will do everything to make it even harder for you.",1,A,2024-01-20T07:20:29.712400Z

I really like these exams since they set us up to develop problem solving skills in the context of coding/jobs and it's definitely worth it if it costs us a couple points. The only issue I have with this is if the curve is based on both professor's classes, since one class had easier exams.

Apart from that Professor Morawski is very good at designing a course meant to actually teach you the concepts and the thought process rather than just regurgitating information that is hand-fed to you.",5,,2024-02-16T22:09:27.587787Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He isn't the worst professor in the CS department, but he's close. He has told us multiple times in lectures to review other professors notes, slides, or practice problems because he isn't able to explain or define the topics clearly himself. His exams are made to be tricky and he puts leetcode style questions throughout, making the exam obnoxiously difficult for no good reason. He is a funny and good guy personally, but is very disorganized and hard to follow during lectures. I would advise taking another professor for 351 if possible.",1,C+,2024-03-13T16:47:29.388019Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max has many issues which keep him from being worth taking at all. His first issue is that he is basically a glorified substitute teacher for the better professor who is Justin Wyss-Gallifent. All Max does is rehash his notes in a worse and confusing manor. He also takes the homeworks directly from Justin, so you begin to wonder what he actually does. Then when the exams come around you find out this is the only reason he wants to teach. He likes to make his exams as difficult and unorthodox as possible. He will put questions that were not remotely covered in class as he teaches the material from Justin's notes word for word and then tests us on questions he personally likes. The other problem is he puts very little effort into it as he just generates the questions using LeetCode then lets his TA's attempt to convince him out of giving some of the terrible questions that are generated. My main issue is that there is no textbook or notes provided from Max to learn how to do these weirder questions that he asks on the exam. Maybe for example if he made his own homework instead of just giving us Justin's, then we would be better prepared for his exams. Due to this 'co-teaching', which is basically copy and paste from Justin, we are prepared for Justin's exams and not Max's exams in the slightest. I would strongly advise against taking him for any class.",1,,2024-03-14T17:25:33.327424Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I'd give this guy 0 stars if I could. His exams are insanely hard for no reason. He expects you to memorize every little minute thing that would never be useful in real life and his lectures suck. At least for cmsc351, he is teaching exactly the same content as another professor (Justin)... just worse and his exams are considerably more difficult. In the past for other classes he's tried to raise the grade requirement for the letter grades (as in an A- would be a 91 instead of a 90 and a 90 would be a B, a B- would be an 88 minimum instead of 87, etc.) and the only reason he didn't was because his TAs all organized against him doing it. He made an exam that had like 20 potential questions and his questions were so bad that the TAs ruled out 15 of them for being overly confusing and impossible to understand. He literally advises all of his students to go to the other professor's lectures and ""jokes"" about how bad of a lecturer he is. He's god awful, I genuinely cannot understate it. This man has singlehandedly caused me an insane amount of stress this semester. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",1,,2024-03-29T03:59:37.927257Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,All these poor reviews are from people who don't put in the effort this class requires. Max is a chill guy and his exams are more than fair. My only negatives would be that he messes up his notes pretty often and that he has a bit of an ego.,3,A,2024-04-08T21:40:26.536267Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I didn't think 351 with Max was very difficult. I got an 84% on the second midterm despite doing ZERO studying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (median was 79%). Still, I didn't enjoy this class because of Max's poor lecturing.

Max evidently cares little about 351, and this is reflected in his shallow lectures. This class was co-taught with Justin, and while I never attended Justin's lectures, I got the feeling that Max's lectures were simply a watered down, superficial version of Justin's lectures. As a result, I mainly relied on self-studying from Justin's notes.

Max still earns 3 stars because he is far from being a terrible professor, although I'm unsure exactly how much of my success is due to the class being co-taught by Justin. Overall, I do recommend Max as a professor.

The 3 midterms we had so far have has 3 totally different structures. Only good thing is for the midterms he gave good hints about what was gonna be asked. 
For the second and third midterm he made his own study material which helped. Maybe he's getting better as the semester progresses, but my grades are already bad due to having a hard time on what to expect. Hopefully he can improve the course in the future.",2,C,2024-04-21T19:46:18.961032Z

He's extremely disorganized, so much so that he doesn't even have a plan of what he's going to teach. Instead he goes to Justin's lectures, takes notes, and regurgitates them to us. He makes it very clear he doesn't know what he's doing. He has even admitted a few times that he didn't know how to solve some of our HW problems. His ego is extremely off-putting, he knows his exams are challenging and that we're not well prepared (both because of the lack of teaching and the lack of any type of practice materials in the format he's looking towards) but he laughs that we're frustrated with him. To put in perspective just how unpredictable his exams can be, he was going to DEDUCT points if we got a true or false question wrong because they're just ""free points"". I understand his teaching philosophy, rather than memorizing he wants us to understand things conceptually, but he doesn't have the skills to teach like that. I really wanted to like him, he can be funny at times, but most of the time he's just downright distracting and way too arrogant for his teaching style.",1,,2024-04-23T05:09:13.846392Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I seriously don't understand why Max gets so much hate and rudeness. He's a funny and engaging lecturer who has a lot of experience and down-to-earth advice about the software industry and where 351 fits in. For context, I took 351 with Max in the Spring 24 when he was co-teaching with Justin. Half the piazza posts were Max students complaining that they couldn't be in Justin's class, or just complaining about the TA's, exams, or class in general which really rubbed me the wrong way and I assume most of these reviews were written by the same people.

Trying to be as unbiased as possible, here are my pros and cons for Max:

Pros
- Funny lecturer who will often regain your attention with a well-timed f bomb
- Adapts throughout the semester based on students needs (got rid of pseudocode questions on exams)
- Him and his TAs are very responsive on piazza (shoutout Elizabeth)
- Is very understanding with questions in class
- Lots of real world/tech job searching experience (former google employee)
- Can be manipulated to give you leniency (his words not mine)

Cons
- I'd argue that exams are unpredictable, not ""hard"" like everyone says. I whiffed on his first midterm with a 70 after studying throughout the week then got a 100 on the next with only a couple hours of studying.
- Had a little trouble explaining some concepts, seemed a little unprepared to lecture on the day's topic at times

P.S. the ""leetcode question"" people are alluding to in other reviews was to code the fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming, just worded a little differently. Climbing Stairs #70 on leetcode if you want to see how ""bad"" it was.",5,A-,2024-04-25T02:42:58.617775Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"This guy bro. He ""coteaches"" with Justin, this means Justin does all the teaching and provides the textbook as well as practice exams. Max provided a single practice exam for exam3 and that too without an answer key to study off of. Then when we finally take the exam they give us barely any partial credit (also don't specify to simplify a function then take off points regardless of equivalence) and the questions were completely unrelated to the content we consumed from Justin's notes, which as some of the other reviews also mention Max told us to use and go to Justin's lectures.

I honestly have no clue how he's being paid at this point he's farming free money from the university without putting in any effort into teaching or even making the tests. Taking this class with him makes me feel bad about paying my tuition knowing any of it is going to this guy.",1,,2024-04-30T05:02:17.849440Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"I would say Max is a very lenient and chill person, as he is very understanding of any problems you have and is very receptive to feedback. Since it was his first time teaching, I would say his lecturing style was pretty disorganized and mistakes were made, but I was able to understand the main concepts in the course. I would say it is fine if you get him for 250, just be ready for some lectures to be all over the place sometimes.",4,A,2024-04-30T16:43:51.591320Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"If you were not able to take Justin, drop the class! Max doesn't even do the bare minimum when teaching, yet he goes out of his way to make exams extremely difficult. He wants to ""challenge"" you, but the execution is terrible. You go through the entire course reading Justin's notes, doing his homework, and practicing his practice exams, yet somehow you're supposed to understand the nonsense that Max puts on his exams. His exams are nothing like what you've practiced in the homework or practice exams. They're really long and theoretical based, which is basically impossible to do within 90 minutes. If you end up taking him, just know that you are not stupid. 351 is genuinely a hard course and Max just does anything he can to give you a hard time.",1,C-,2024-04-30T22:38:25.157278Z

- Exams are not hard, but are confusing
   - questions on exams test for irrelevant and unrelated material
   - rubric/point system for his exams express that you only need to get the exact answer down. Displaying a 90% understanding in the material results in 0 points.

All he does is regurgitate Justin's notes but he can't even do that well as he's always skipping over things. This honestly just show's how he's terrible at his job especially when his peers are significantly better professors.",1,B+,2024-05-02T20:24:40.360262Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"In theory Max's class should create a better learning environment because he prioritizes actually understanding the concepts at a deeper level rather then just being able to 're-run' the algorithm on a new set of numbers. However in practice the class is terrible. He is a bad lecturer that gets off topic very often and copies straight from Justins notes. He teaches the same content as Justin and has the same HW, but creates his own exams.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I started the semester liking Max as he seemed down-to-earth and funny. However, he quickly became arrogant and rude towards his students in a matter of weeks. He has made many jokes about how his exams are hard and he thinks it's funny that we are stressed as a result. I also went into his office hours to talk about my grade and he was super unwelcoming, basically rushing me to leave his office. 
Max puts little to no effort into this class as Justin prepares all lecture material and homeworks for him. He would often forget how to do something or explain a topic so badly that he had to pause class to reference Justin's notes. A few times, he even had to re-explain the topics during the next lecture. The one thing Max did do was write his own exams, which contained extremely hard questions and were pretty unfair based on the fact that Max students only had Justin type questions to practice with. (Justin would also give out 3-5 practice exams per midterm, while Max students would be lucky to receive a sloppy, last-minute thrown-together practice)
He has set up this class so it is extremely hard to get higher than a B-. It feels like every assignment has been graded subjectively, where graders are looking for any reason to take points from students. Max has also made it so that many of the homework and exam questions are graded all-or-nothing style with zero hope for regrades. Based on the fact that 83.3% of your grade in this course is based off of exams, exams are made based on what Max is feeling at the moment with little practice provided, and homeworks are graded as harshly as exams, Max does not have his students best interests at heart.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Not the best when it comes to fair exams (compared to Justin, for example) but I did enjoy some of his lectures. Super fun to listen to about topics that he's interested in and his exams are, while grade-destroying, very interesting to look at in hindsight. It really forces you to understand the algorithms beyond memory, at least. He's a generally understanding guy though - if you talk to him about your concerns, he'll hear you out and give good advice on what to do and how to change what your current study methods are. 
TLDR: Take Max if you really want to be pushed beyond just understanding algorithms, but don't expect fair exams or clear/concise lectures.",3,B-,2024-05-08T16:26:55.710248Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max is a very engaging professor who loves to crack jokes and is more of a casual professor than a professional professor, he's just a guy. This could be a hit or miss for some but for me personally, I liked it as it made me take the class more as a sport than a super stressful life-changing course if that makes sense. I know some people are giving him loads of backlash about difficulty or disorganization but I feel that when he was co-teaching with Kruskal it shifted his perspectives a bit, so you have to wiggle around that.

Pros, Cons, Subjectives
!! I put a * next to the important parts which heavily impacted my experience. !!

Pros:
- Very down to earth.
* - The TAs are very good! They care (shoutout to Elizabeth Qiu) and are on our side for success. She even made a Spotify playlist for studying.
* - Tells you what will be on the exam quite literally. 
- As much as it doesn't seem so, he does listen to student feedback. There was a type of question most students disliked and Max has vowed never to give a question like that again. As of today before the final, he has not given us a question like that.
- In addition to student feedback, he also interacts with his students. One of the students made a drawing of Max, and that is now his piazza profile picture.
* - If you are into his more casual style, he likes to crack jokes or give some experience
- Responsive via piazza, and also pretty interactive there.
- If he did a really bad job explaining a topic in lecture and you were unfortunate enough to be in there, Max will acknowledge this and put out a recording of the following class which he hopes is much more clear. THIS ADDS A POINT: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Cons:
* - As others said, he is very disorganized, he is still new at teaching the course.
* - If you are not into his more casual style, then you may not like him very much (or at all, he can talk a lot)
- Sometimes do not post notes, and no recordings unless you are sick. If you were to miss a topic, you will self-teach yourself (Abdul Bari is goated)
- Sometimes a review sheet is put out, but there won't be solutions, and students are forced to make an unofficial solutions page. 
- Sometimes misses his lectures and a TA teaches the lecture. Luckily, the TAs are very good! (Shoutout to Elizabeth and Lana).
* - I will say this again: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Subjective:
* - While Max is very disorganized if you were to attend the lectures then everything seems to make sense. You are punished for not going to his lecture, especially since with the point that he tells you what is in the exam in terms of the layout, and the questions it will ask, you are missing quite a lot. I encourage you to go to lecture. It is very beneficial.
* - Exams can be very hard.  I was able to get good marks on exams 2 and 3 (95%>) but failed the first exam, like bombed, destroyed, so it averages out to a C+. The first exam was on the unfair side I feel (and so did everyone else, peep the reviews from 2024) and additionally the TAs had to convince Max to not put a couple more insanely hard questions. However, for the rest of the exams, Max tries to change it up to favor us. On exam 2, there were multiple choice which tank your grade if you got just a couple wrong so in exam 3, he avoided this by giving us more small questions that gave partial even if you were not fully right. This goes towards the pro I mentioned where he listens to feedback. 
* - In addition, I felt the exams were fair. THE WAY MAX MAKES HIS EXAM IS MORE THAN MEMORIZATION (Apart from master theorem)! Max loves conceptual questions so you must understand how and why something works instead of memorizing how to do something. I eventually learned how to think this way, but others won't be as fortunate.
* - Homework can be a pain because sometimes the stuff on the homework has not been taught because for us the homework was made by Justin. I don't know how this will go when Max starts teaching it fully by himself. Find a homework group! It makes homework very doable.
- No discussion personally was a plus, but I know others prefer having discussion to discuss topics more.
- Max is a swiftie. I don't know if this is important but probably worth putting. 
- The students will complain a lot (mainly exams), and for good reasons too. However, sometimes I see people justifying their bad grades from it when really the exams are pretty alright. Max and is way of exams just may be different than what we're used to. 
* - Yes, Max likes to tell us to look at Justin's notes but only because due to his disorganization, he wants us to look at more material. Additionally, he is relearning everything also which is why he encourages it as well, just so we get correct information. This could be bad for some as it may seem like a waste of time to go to a lecture. 

I was going to give 3 stars but I am giving 4 stars because I don't think we gave him a fair chance. He is trying his best and he adjusts the exams more in our favor, but designs his exams so that cramming is not beneficial. He also gives reviews, and good reviews too personally. He and his TAs take the time to give videos and exam logistics. I appreciate Max and his TAs for doing their best. The winning aspect for me is Max feels more human. He is not professional by all means but for me that made my experience much more enjoyable (but I know most may not like this). You have to get used to his exams and his teaching style (and accept that he will be messy and disorganized).",4,C+,2024-05-12T09:27:32.842437Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He's definitely pretty bad as far as this class goes but I do feel most people are extra whiny when it comes to his class. Yes, he is a subpar lecturer in terms of his depth of knowledge on the topics and he usually goes to Justin's lecture and would attempt to replicate everything Justin did in his class but unsuccessfully. Yes, his exams are wildly inconsistent and generally more difficult than Justins (who's aren't, let's be real) who he co-taught with. However, part of the difficulty of the exams are because the HW's are all Justin's style and they don't prepare you for Max style exams. Now idk if this is his fault and if he even has the ability to interject and make sweeping changes to something like the HW but if the HW's were a little more theoretical than his exams would be easier. I had him for 250 and that class was a lot easier and smooth because you could usually redo the homework's for good exam practice. And of course, most people will cry about the infamous leetcode question that appeared on exam 1. There was enough outrage that the question ended up getting curved off and any points you got from it would be bonus points. His exams in general are very theoretical and don't allow you to rely on memorizing patterns of algorithms, unlike Justin who like any math teacher will simply change the numbers and give you the exact same problem again for an exam. I feel as though part of the issues are just the class structure because Max was fine for 250 when he could do everything his way. Frankly most professors will seem terrible when they have to stand next to Justin and teach the same class so it's not all his fault but still, he has his issues and I'd recommend to avoid",2,C+,2024-05-12T22:51:26.533796Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Took this class in Fall 2023 and it's one of my favorite CS classes I've taken. Prior to this class I had no experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, or even Python. I think a lot of the negative reviews are because Max isn't a conventional teacher, which is understandable if that's what you're looking for. However, if you believe this is a subject that you might be interested in, then I think Max is the perfect teacher for it. Compared to Fardina's class, Max was much less concerned with the math and specific details behind many of the topics we learned. What he cared about what your conceptual understanding of the topics and how you would apply them to real applications like a true data scientists would. It's certainly hard to break out of the traditional test taking mindset, however I found that the projects were a great way to learn how to apply the topics.

TLDR: Unconventional teaching style in a good way, but if you have no desire to learn data science, do not take him.",5,A-,2024-05-14T12:16:51.534424Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"The ""coteaching"" was nonexistent, but I don't think that was bad. Max teaches you a much more intuition-based course than Justin, and consequently, it's much harder to study for, which people complain about. The only thing they shared was homework, and because Max teaches differently than Justin, this certainly led to issues and reading Justin's notes to understand a question.

Other than that, I enjoyed his class. The exams were fair but difficult, and it felt like they tested my knowledge rather than inane details of the algorithms. Overall, I think Max's class is more useful in the long term because you will remember most of what he taught you, as they are vibes rather than precise answers.

Also, the Piazza was great (shoutout to Elizabeth and her quick answers).",4,B+,2024-05-15T00:08:34.285772Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Do not take Max if you can. This semester was co-taught with Justin. Sounds good, right? Well Max uses Justin's lecture notes which is fine - even if he always (and I mean always) made some mistakes in lecture. We also used Justin's homeworks, so everything seems to be great, right? Well in this class where the exams make up pretty much your entire grade, for some reason Max has decided that this is the one part of the course he wants to be original with. We get next to no preparation on the exams because all our homeworks are Justin's homeworks and while Justin generously gives his students previous semester exams to go back on and study with solutions attached, Max gave out nothing for the first exam, one practice with no solutions for exam 2 and 3, and only a review sheet for the final. It's not that I think Justin should scale back or that I'm not grateful that Max gave out at least something. It's the fact that Max's teaching does not prepare you for his exams. We learned additional topics and a different algorithm for Floyd's than Justin's class, yet the homeworks did not cover this because we were taking Justin's homeworks, and Max only uploads like half of his lecture notes for some reason. Not that his lecture notes help that much in the first place, when I look at his lecture notes I have to go and cross-reference Justin's notes if I can because Max teaches from Justin's notes most the time, yet his notes do not have in mind the fact that 90% of the things he writes is lost when reviewing them outside of lecture. I do not understand why Max insists on co-teaching with Justin just to give unique exams.

Max could've improved by realizing that it was probably detrimental to his students in create a separate exam from Justin for this semester at least. At the very least he could've put more effort into mirroring the amount of review material Justin gives, but I guess Max can do whatever he wants since at the end of the day, it is still his class. Even on the final exam Justin was very organized and gave his class the exact topics and weightings of said final exam questions, while Max on piazza said that the exam questions were ""chosen from a grab bag of the topics we've covered."" and that's pretty much all that we were given. 

I highly suggest you avoid this class with Max at all costs, or at least until Max shows improvement in understanding how to build good exams and prepare his students to excel on the exams instead of creating obscure exam questions which he thinks are interesting and expects us to do during a timed test. If you end up taking this class with Max, you will only be having a harder time. For people who do end up taking this class, whether by choice or by force, please be nice on Piazza, especially to the TA's. The TA's were here to help us do well and tried their best (remember that they are also students), yet they ended up taking most of the criticism this semester. The TA's already relayed the criticisms to the Professors, so reiterating the same critiques to the TA's did nothing and just caused more frustrations on their end. This also ended up cross contaminating with the 330 piazza which is just ultimately not ok. Max seemed to be very stubborn with how he taught the course so just save the TA's (and your time since complaining on piazza resulted in 0 change) some time and email the professor or talk to them on OH if you can.",1,,2024-05-15T00:35:42.836122Z

So here’s the deal:
Max is nice, and he’s a decent lecturer. TAs being rough graders probably happens every semester, and it sucked

However:
- His exams have been wildly inconsistent in question style and point distribution, but overall the questions were weirdly phrased and not the kind we dealt with on the HW. The rubrics for the questions were not student-friendly. Be prepared to argue on gradescope.
- He almost got every ADS student’s final cancelled because he forgot to confirm it on time, which led to all of us scrambling over the weekend. He also once submitted an exam so late that ADS printed the previous exam and had to delay our testing by half an hour to get the right one.
- The material didn’t line up with what his co-prof taught, he didn’t record, and his notes were worthless.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max's lectures and notes often feel messy and incomplete in comparison to Justin's. I started off going to his lectures, and for simple topics, his lectures suffice. But for exams and most of the course material, you have to rely on Justin. My biggest grievance was like most students: from what I've gathered Max's exams were disproportionately harder than Justin's. I understand that most classes have professors who do things completely differently, but when you establish that you're co-teaching with him, I expect similarities whether it comes to exam difficulty, the method of the algorithms, notes, etc. He really wants you to understand the content on a deep level which I appreciate, but the exams punish you if you can't, and since this class is co-taught, it is kind of frustrating to hear when the neighboring professor's students are getting easier A's. Regardless though, a B and above is possible if you really grind so don't be discouraged if you're stuck with him.",2,B,2024-05-16T04:15:52.420956Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Warning: If you're looking at Spring 2024 semester reviews, you're gonna get a lot of bootlickers and people giving dramatic one-star reviews. Unfortunately they became very very vocal during the semester on Piazza and took over the entire class. So be aware when people are going overboard criticizing or praising Max.

Some people may not like his personality (not sure how to describe it, it can come off a little cocky), but he's a nice person. The issue is that his class is run like a disaster. Class notes don't get posted for months and they're fairly nonsensical to follow. He clearly makes no effort to prepare for lectures ahead of time; he made a ton of mistakes that caused lectures to contradict each other and cause a bunch of confusion unnecessarily. To add insult to injury, his UNDERGRADUATE teaching assistant taught better than him when he was absent. There were also some serious incidents involving TAs that got swept under the rug. Two TAs were straight up shit-talking students vocally and there were no repercussions except a ""hey, don't talk about that in office hours"" from him. The exams asked very vague questions that contradicted lecture material sometimes and oftentimes had multiple possible answers, but only one deemed correct. He also asked some questions about developing algorithms to solve problems. If we're going to get questions like that on exams, homework assignments or lectures should build those skills, as this is an analysis of algorithms course and it's not the main focus.

Max has his fans—I think it's great that he tries to build a community with interested students in such a large school. But I think he's emblematic of this UMD CS' institutional failures to provide consistent, quality instruction to undergraduates. That any instructor can exhibit such seemingly acute indifference to the material and helping students succeed is a total embarrassment to this university's claims of supposed high rankings and talented, accessible faculty.",2,A-,2024-05-17T00:07:17.714424Z

This makes the class significantly harder than it has to be, so I’d recommend relying on outside sources (such as Justin’s notes for 351) to learn the material. On the plus side, he is one of the more entertaining CS lecturers, his exams actually rely on applying the theory you have learned rather than memorization (some people don’t like this), and he is willing to take feedback.

Max is a great guy that is more personable than almost all the rest of the CS professors combined, with great knowledge about the course topics to boot. 

Sure, his class wasn’t even 40% as organized as Justin’s class, but what the people in this review section fail to realize is that Max and Justin’s exam averages were pretty similar, Justin’s averages being only 2% higher at most. The only discrepancy in this is exam 3, where which there was an 8% difference in averages, but I feel that Max recognized this and made the final exam a bit easier and more fair to compensate. Most of these reviews are complaining about a singular Leetcode problem on the first exam, which, in all regards, was unfair, but after that point, he swore to not include any more of those types of questions, or even pseudocode questions for that matter.

Max’s exams are different, in the sense that they test a lot on how well you can dissect a concept and see if you really understand it, which I think is a much better way of getting students to learn the content, as opposed to mindlessly doing problems as quickly and efficiently as possible.

For the final, he taught a different algorithm method from Justin, whom he was supposed to CO-TEACH with, as well as added multiple different algorithms from Justin. At that point, bro didn't even co-teach, and he made this decision in the middle of the semester which was very stressful. I am very grateful for the TAs in this class: I don't think I could've passed without them, but I can't help but think that the TAs in this class would be less stressed if Max was more organized.

Max took all the material from the main lecturer (Justin) and then proceeded to explain it in the way that he wanted, which was kind of sloppy at times. For instance, he would end class early because he considered there was nothing else to talk about (even though Justin's notes contained more material), he would have one of the worst handwriting I've ever seen, which did not make things easier (no offense), and he would run out of battery on his iPad in multiple occasions, interrupting the flow of the class. He would also talk about hypothetical scenarios in algorithms that he would just love to put on his exams, which ended up being more ambiguous than Justin's, leading to a lower average in every single one of his exams. The Piazza went crazy multiple times just because of his methods and the kind of questions that he would put on his exams.
Now, from a personal perspective, this was one of the hardest CS classes that I've taken. I just felt that no matter how much I studied for each exam, there would just be this set of questions that you would just not be prepared for, which was really frustrating. You would have the same homeworks as Justin's section, which saved my grade because I did really well on those, but they barely correlate with what you need to be prepared for in the exams (Which is 83% of your grade!!!). I ended up just barely passing the class despite having solid A's and B's in all my other classes and allocating significantly more time to this class.

Things to take note of that happened with him this semester: impossible question on the makeup for exam 1s (seemed like something went wrong in their exam making process, so prob won't happen again, but still good to know), often told students to go to the other professor's lecture if they didn't enjoy his, would mostly learn most of the stuff he was teaching during class (this wasn't as bad as it was in 250), not very passionate for the material. He did make some improvements since when he taught CMSC250, but still not good. I learned more from Justin's notes than his lectures.

Lectures aren't too great for learning and is honestly more worth to study off of Justin's op notes, but I will say Max's lectures have a very inclusive feel with his quirky and funny personality. Records lectures but you need to email him for it to promote more people coming to class.

This semester, despite co-teaching Justin's class, Max decided to do his own thing. This includes straight up teaching a few different material  than Justin, even teaching one concept his own way that is required for the exam, and creating completely different exams which were noticably more difficult to study for. His first exam had a leetcode problem that was told in advance to only those attending his lectures, his second one had a large proportion of your grade in a few mc questions, and his third one was half straightforward do the algorithm types of questions while the other half were difficult conceptual questions. The third exams format was the same style as the final, which was really well written in a way that actually makes you think.

The leetcode question that other people are referring to is a question Max gave us very fair warning about (he basically told us it would be a DP leetcode easy) of which there are only a few. So if you practiced those beforehand (or even tried to figure it out on the exam), you likely would have gotten it.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max is a really nice guy but he's a terrible professor and tries to make up for it by trying to seem like our friend. He seems really smart but can't articulate ideas properly. Multiple times, he would try to lecture on a topic, forget/not know how to explain, and then just say forget about it it's not on the exam or to refer to Justin's notes. After the first exam, I stopped going to class altogether because it was completely useless. Furthermore, his handwriting and lecture notes are terrible and therefore impossible to follow. Ultimately, you end up reading Justin's notes to teach yourself all the material. This class was supposed to be cotaught so this shouldn't be an issue. However, despite Max's inability to teach, he wants to be quirky and ask us questions that are not reflective of the material we learn all semester. Though the class is cotaught, the only similarities between Justin and Max are the homeworks, which are common between the two. The problem here is that Max makes his own exams despite using Justin's homework but doesn't give us proper practice so you can't really prepare for Max exams when you are studying. All these issues led to a massive grade discrepancy on each of the midterms between Justin and Max(totaled to about -7-8% of ur final grade if you took Max). He did not release his final averages so I can't really say too much about that but throughout the semester, it was blatant how unfair the class was and how unreceptive Max was overall. This would all be ok if Max decided to account for this discrepancy when setting grade cutoffs at the end of the semester to ""equalize"" a class that is cotaught and should be equalized regardless. However, Max being max dropped grade cutoffs by about 2% meaning that you were at about a 5-6% disadvantage if you took Max vs Justin. Max is a nice guy but do not take him for any class if you care for your GPA at all",2,B+,2024-05-22T16:13:57.333506Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,his exams are so unrelated to lecture materials,2,B,2024-05-22T17:03:06.029892Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Funny guy. Was ""co teaching"" with Justin. We had the same homework as Justin. However, instead of making the exams have a connection to the homework, like Justin's exams, Max wanted to be different the entire semester, resulting in lower exam averages, especially comparing to Justin students.",1,F,2024-05-23T01:46:56.539224Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Trying to accurately reflect on CMSC351 with Max is a challenging endeavor.  It'd be far too easy to say something like ""Max not Justin despite coteaching, therefore bad.""  I don't think it's that simple, especially since I already don't have the highest opinion of Justin for CMSC351.

First things first, lectures.  Currently, Max just doesn't pull off taking notes live during lecture like Justin does.  He often spends a lot of time during lecture just on taking notes, presumably from his own reference.  This takes away time he could be using to properly work through examples, since he is fairly unclear and/or makes mistakes on some of the examples in lecture.  I don't think Max is experienced enough with the material to pull off live note-taking without sacrificing something else about the lecture.  I think lectures would be much better if he mainly used slides for introducing material, and worked out examples live to emphasize the major takeaways.  Max certainly has the energy to be a good lecturer, but the lectures this semester weren't great.  It doesn't help Max's case that he was out for many lectures where one of the head TAs, Lana, took over, and honestly I thought she was a much better lecturer.

Next, the inconsistency with Justin.  I could whine about exams here, but I'll save that for a bit.  My main issue with inconsistency actually comes with the different notions Justin and Max used for a few of the algorithms.  Two notably come to mind: Dijkstra's and Floyd's.  In a cotaught class, even if the exams are different, I believe that the content taught across the two sections should be the same at the very least.  With Dijkstra's, Justin's notes, lectures, and psuedocode were very clear about how the algorithm should be interpreted in the context of the class, which is done to get everyone on the same page when doing Dijkstra's algorithm problems on homework and exams.  Max's students needed to know Justin's interpretation because we had Justin's homework throughout the course.  It was very clear that Justin's interpretation of the algorithm records the shortest path between the start node and every other node reachable in the graph, whereas Max's interpretation has the algorithm stop upon reaching a destination node.  I actually brought this up, which Max agreed with me, and both interpretations were made acceptable for that problem on exam 3.  Something in the same vein happened with Floyd's algorithm, where Justin's interpretation had a ""Pass By"" for each node in the graph, where Max's was something completely different.  This wasn't the worst thing in the world, because the Floyd's algorithm problem on Max's final was explicit in exactly what it wanted (shortest paths of every node to every node where the maximum number of edges on each path is 2).  However, the sentiment is the same.  Something related to this point is that Max's section did not cover shortest path algorithm, but covered bucket sort where Justin didn't... for some reason...

Alright, now it's time for exams.  Simply put, these exams were very experimental, and they did not work with Justin's grade weights of 1/6 homework, 1/6 per semester exam, and 1/3 final.  The first exam was structured very similarly to a Justin exam, except with a Leetcode easy at the end.  Oddly enough, this was the only exam I got an A on, despite the fact that I'm typically horrendous at Leetcode.  Regardless, people were vocal about despising it, so Max changed the exam structure entirely for the following exams.  Each of the following exams had a few Justin-style ""run through the algorithm"" questions, but were majorly based on more theoretical questions which I turned out to be terrible at.  Exam 2 had 30% of its score determined by 6 multiple choice questions, and some of the questions were poorly written and/or relied on knowing niche facts before you could even come close to a valid response.  Exam 3 was mostly fine, but two questions in particular emphasized memory, which isn't something we really practiced in class in any capacity.  The final was mostly fine, but a few of the questions were weighted a crazy amount, and there were a fair amount of gotchas with small, but significant point reductions throughout the exam.  I did not clutch up on the final, and I screwed up so much compared to how I wanted to do that I only qualified for an A- with a small unknown curve.  I'll take it, but at the same time I wanted to do better in this course, but I didn't know how to prepare for the exams.  I'll accept that this is a pretty big skill issue, since the exam distributions throughout the semester were honestly pretty high for both professors (Justin's were typically a few points higher on the mean, with exam 3 having an 8 percent mean disparity, but Max's averages weren't bad).  However, I also don't think this class structure was setting most people up for success, and it didn't seem that we were given much leeway while Max was figuring out what he wanted his exams to be like.  It's honestly a shame, because I can see what Max was going for with the exams.  But they simply don't work with the grade weights we were given, and after exam 1, they were mostly independent from Justin's homework which we had to do throughout the semester.

I'm conflicted.  I want to give Max a higher rating, because I genuinely believe that this class wasn't designed to hurt the students.  Max may have some amount of arrogance or whatever, but he is genuinely willing to hear you out on issues you may have, especially if you have valid points when it comes to regrades (personal experience).  However, what keeps my rating low is that this run of CMSC351 was just rough.  I feel like a lot of decisions were made just to be made, rather than for the benefit of the students.  In a sense, it was almost like taking two different algorithms classes in the same semester.  For homeworks, we had to be good at Justin-style questions, which tended to be very specific in what they were asking and the answers they wanted.  For exams, we had to be good at Max-style questions, which tended to be far more vague and/or theoretical, but the answers they expected were still very specific.  It was very tiring.",2,A-,2024-05-23T15:32:18.401211Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I lowkey didn't mind him. He gave really good hints about what was going to be on the exams and exams were more about knowing the algorithms in a high level than just knowing how to execute them. First exam was bad for me because I didn't go to lectures but after that I started going and he used to tell you everything you might need for an exam. That being said he is a bit disorganized and does go off topic at times.

I also appreciate his office hours when he's there - he explains things over and over again if you don't listen (ex. I asked him to explain 3-SAT since he hinted it might be on the final and I did not understand it, and he took over 20 minutes to explain it again and again to me and the students who stopped by to listen). His exams are pretty tough and a bit of a shock at first (I bombed the first midterm and spent the rest of the semester dragging my grade back up lol), but looking back, I find that I liked how they were written. It's less repeating what you memorized and more applying what you learned, which I think is very useful.",3,B-,2024-07-01T20:49:24.453458Z

I recommend going to practice sessions if you want a better grade in the course. His tests are decently tricky, but he curves the tests and allows those who know the topic well to get ahead. I would take him again, just plan to use either Justin's notes or another source of practice to excel in his class, and plan for somewhat long tangent discussions in class.",4,A-,2024-08-07T19:00:12.976301Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He is pretty knowledgeable but explains almost every concept very poorly (almost like he's forcing himself to use bigger words than he should). The class was very disorganized: we were told there would be about 8 projects and 2 in-class assignments (basically quizzes), but it ended up only being 5 homeworks and 1 in-class assignment—take this as you will. 
Not only are his lectures hard to understand, but he also prides himself on making EXTREMELY DIFFICULT EXAMS that are often very vague or open-ended, in all the wrong ways. He masquerades this by claiming that it's better to truly know the content deeply while making questions somehow subjective (which does the opposite btw) and by claiming that it'll be helpful in the workforce. 
The only reedamble parts of this class and the professor overall are that the homeworks were generally pretty easy and that he is a nice guy at heart. 
Overall, since he doesn't teach you how to use Python, pandas, or SQL but basically all homeworks regard these, I wouldn't recommend unless (1) you really want to take this class, (2) think you can success in spite of everything I've said, or (3) LOVE DATA SCIENCE.",2,A-,2024-12-16T04:19:37.425365Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Pretty polarizing.

This review is coming from the perspective of someone who also had Max for 351, so there will be many comparisons. But overall honestly, I think Max has the potential to get somewhat better over time, though this semester was kinda scuffed.

Max always said in class that he was more interested in data science than algorithms, but I was somewhat doubtful about whether taking 320 with Max would actually be better. Turns out it is... kind of. This class in general is much easier than CMSC351, so that's one thing for starters. There's a large buffer for your grade in 46% of assignments in the final grade. As the review below mentions, there were many more planned assignments, and they never happened: which wasn't that surprising, given that two (or really one tbh) of the assignments were extremely long.

Tests are hit or miss. Coming from 351, there are basically no ""Justin"" questions (it's almost all Max-y, but there are some questions that are much more direct and less abstract). The first test was highly curved due to poor writing, and honestly, this is something I disliked more than anything besides the abstractness (I honestly found their abstract nature fun at points). Questions are purposely vague, and likely to make you think, but it makes it really easy to misread or gauge a question's intent incorrectly.

Now, onto what I think could get better. The 1st assignment was writing... which was fairly useless, and Max realized this for next semester. The second assignment was fairly standard pandas/SQL stuff, but the 3rd assignment is where it got interesting. The 3rd assignment is honestly the best assignment in CS I've gotten ever, which I'm surprised I'm saying. It is VERY messy and very unclear, but that's partially the point, it is honestly the best way to learn stuff, and honestly reminded me of my past work/personal project experience. Probably the best assignment to actually learn, even if it was unforgiving and took forever.

I really wish the next 2 assignments had this caliber, but they were quite mundane. I know some people might think I'm crazy for suggesting that he add more assignments like HW3, but I honestly think assignments like those are probably the best way to genuinely learn about data science. 

Another problem with the homework was that ending concepts didn't really have that much focus in the last assignments, but I also realized that it would have been hard to create interesting homework based on those concepts.

Extra credit was quite scuffed this semester. Max initially made it 0.01% of the final grade, and just to put into reference how small this was: 3 notes was supposed to be 0.01%, and he changed it to be 0.05% PER NOTE. That's a 15x change, and frankly, it goes to show how little it was worth (and people thus didn't care much). Again, I do think this will hopefully get better with time.

Max's teaching style is sort of like how he was in 351, though he definitely was generally more knowledgeable about the concepts he was teaching (definitely not perfect though). It seems he didn't really care enough to make coherent slides, which led to really vague and hard-to-understand slideshows if you didn't attend the lecture. I think this is probably the most iffy point I have on Max that prevents me from giving him a higher rating because while I do think he will probably change the extra credit system/assignments, I am not sure if he will improve his teaching.

Overall though, I'd say Max is a slight upgrade from how he was in 351. As I said, comparatively to 351, this class is nowhere near as hard, though still somewhat poorly managed. Yet, there are some slight shimmers of something great, that makes the class somewhat valuable: maybe not for everyone, but definitely to some.",3,A,2024-12-18T05:06:08.403765Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I had this guy for 351 and somehow he got a lower rating from me for 320 than that class AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. At least in 351, I walked out feeling like I knew how to apply the algorithms. It was disorganized, but it was fine. 320 however....I got a higher grade but I got majorly screwed by the final because it was essentially a midterm 3 on topics he just likes to skate over instead of actually covering in a structured method. Maybe I would have done fine if the rubric wasn't also all or nothing style with 4 points for some questions. Exams are so weird and the grades keep fluctuating because it turns out he made mistakes in the answer key/rubric.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"TL;DR - If you want to go into Data Science as a career, then you should take Max. Otherwise, stay far FAR away.

Pros:
- Everything he teaches is from a practical perspective. He frames the class and his lectures in a way that would actually help someone in the future if they wanted to go into data science. This is something that a lot of CS classes fail to do in high school and college, so finding a course that directly prepares you for a career in the subject area is rare. So as someone who wants to go into Data Sci / AI / ML, this class was incredibly helpful.
- He's a fun guy
- We got an A on pretty much all of the homework assignments

Cons: 
- The exams were really tough. He makes exams so that all of the questions are open ended and require critical thinking. Because of this, it's hard to figure out what to expect on an exam. He only gave us one practice exam for each of our exams, so there just wasn't that much material to prepare with. It felt like you either knew it or you didn't.
- The class and lectures are incredibly disorganized. We had at least 3 lectures where he showed up with an unfinished slideshow. He knows all of the material that he's gonna teach, he just sometimes shows up unprepared to lectures. The class is also disorganized as well. Many assignments were posted days or weeks after they should've been.
- None of the assignments had a clear rubric. We were given very little instruction on what we should actually be doing for some of assignments. This led to a lot of late night frustration as we just didn't know what the right answer for a given problem was supposed to be. This was because of how little specification was given for the assignments.",3,A,2025-01-25T17:49:36.437191Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is a really nice guy and on the first day of class got me excited about the course by telling some very interesting stories about his time in the industry. This was the first time in a CS class that I had been excited to learn or thought to myself, “wow that sounds like something I want to do when I graduate.”

That is why I’m extra disappointed by this class. I suspect that all the Max does to prepare for each day is make a general list of things he wants to talk about and the occasional very plain PowerPoint which he doesn’t stick to. What happens in class is that he simply rambles about said topics without any semblance of structure. There are no key points even if he is using a visual aid. Max will often hand write notes but this is pretty spotty and no one would be able to understand the full picture if they were to try to go back and look at the notes. It is often as if his lectures are simply a conversation between him and people sitting in the front row which quickly breaks down the flow of class and creates too many tangents. It also reveals how unprepared he is when people ask questions and he realizes he should have planned to address that but that it had slipped his mind. This is only a small summary of the issues in this class. Projects are way too hard in comparison for how casually he teaches and test questions seem to be first drafts without any revision.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"This review is after Maks addressed what has happened in the class and the midterm recently, which is why you are going to wonder why all the 1 star reviews.
I do agree that he isn't the greatest lecturer, and that a lot of topics that he very lightly brushed on the exam came in full force in the midterm, however I am posting this after he gave an EXTREMELY generous curve and on top of that he admitted that a lot of the questions that seemed out of scope of the class or  that were badly written, well that was actually the case, and he made it up within the curve that he gave us.

It's his first time teaching this course, not sure if actually it's his first time lecturing huge sections, and actually. I was frustrated too with his lectures but I can see why he wants us to learn all of this and he is trying to re-make the class. It's to get us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys who just do python,sql, and stuff to whatever we are told to do for the projects. He is a caring and great guy and I have never seen instructors be so caring to the point of admitting their own mistakes and taking student input in order to improve.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The way that CMSC320 is being taught in the fall 2022 is a disaster. 
The class was known as a easy CMSC elective class. But it is not this semester. Morawski is a cool, fun guy. Maybe caring according to my friends, but he is far away from good professor this semester. 
He has a few little lecture slides at the beginning of the semester, but no more after he decided to remake the class. We get speaker notes sometimes, but it is only converging the topics he went over. Furthermore, the lectures he gave doesn't teach us how to do our projects and exams well. We basically need to learn how to do the project on our own - it is much workload that I was expecting for CMSC320. It is probably the workload similar to CMSC216. BTW I start projects early so I can ask TA for help, but they are still time consuming and suffering because you have to find out what are expecting (the project description doesn't always tell you where you graded on) and teach yourselves (since you didn't really learn how to do the project yourself)
Also, I do agree that he is trying to make ""us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys"". But we need to think data-wise AND how to code.  
Many of the exams questions went far away from the scope of the class. And some are bad written. The projects we did (and cmsc320 is project heavy class) probably worth 6 points in the 42 points exam (which is 32 after he gave curve). Also there is no timer on the gradescope when we took the exam so we will realize ""we had to time ourselves!"" after you read the exam starts 3-5 mins. 
He might improve next semester (Spring 2023) based on the feedback he got this semester, but honestly, if you have choice, try to wait a semester to see how it went . At this point, I will say he is definitely 1/5 at CMSC320.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The main issue is poor organization in lecture. Does not provide clear explanations of each topic nor specific examples. Hand written notes are his passing thoughts rather than coherent, structured notes. I often leave class feeling as if I learned nothing. I struggle to take notes because of lack of structure in lectures. Exam was not very relevant to what was covered in lecture, but he is working on this for the next one! Lectures are not really related to the projects.

Despite all this, Max is a funny and really cool dude. I enjoy talking to him and hearing his thoughts and stories. It's obvious he's working to improve. I appreciate he has industry experience, which he ties to what we're learning!

My recommendations for improvement: 
- Organize lectures with clear explanations of each data science technique, use cases, and relevant examples. 
- Create more organized hand written notes that can serve as a reference. 
- Review key concepts necessary for projects and exams.
- Keep sharing cool stories and industry insights!",2,A,2022-11-10T00:27:45.065723Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Everyone who gave him a 5 star review doesn't understand that just by curving an exam by 30% makes you a better professor. His lectures are still uninteresting, he goes on niche tangents with 3 kids in the class that make lecture an unbearable nightmare where you don't learn anything. I'm willing to bet that the 3 people who gave him those 5 star reviews are the same people who sit front of the class asking him questions to get him to go on random tangents for 90 minutes.",1,A,2022-11-10T00:57:54.400526Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,Really nice guy passionate about data science. Not a good teacher. If you want to self-teach yourself all of the content in this course then take Maks. His lectures are hard to follow as they involve at least 3 tangents minimum. He is not organized and it is very unclear on how much we need to know about mentioned topics. This makes studying almost impossible. I only did well on the first exam due to prior knowledge and google. I would recommend taking this class with someone else and make your life easier.,1,A+,2022-11-10T23:46:14.584872Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Take it with someone else if you actually want to learn something. He's a nice guy, but doesn't really teach anything substantial that's useful for the projects and exams. He talks about various topics at a very surface level but doesn't go into any of the details. The first exam was just STAT 400 questions and student-made questions from Piazza. Also the things we were tested on he didn't really go into much detail in in lecture. Only thing that I have found valuable from this class so far are the projects created by previous professors for the course.",1,A,2022-11-12T00:24:42.136849Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Professor Max is a super down to earth dude. I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. 

The way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. 

Projects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don’t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn’t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don’t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it’s just how it is unfortunately 

Exam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it’s only really bad if the professor isn’t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn’t even a big deal

Lectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn’t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you’re a geek that doesn’t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn’t for you. 

Overall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. 

Other ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I’m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn’t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn’t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that’s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you’ll like Max. If you’re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.

Conclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit",5,B,2022-11-12T11:32:52.662848Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience. Max shares his work stories about projects he did and how he did them, which is a lot more valuable to me then just coursework

Max is a breath of fresh air in the sea of super boring work heavy CMSC courses, love the dude

This is his first semester teaching the course and he is very gracious with curves and listens to student concerns. Super down to earth dude. Some technical difficulties in the class but he’s working on them

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Has a super fun personality. Unfortunately, this personality also involves him being incredibly hand-wavy for just about every topic, making it impossible to do the projects or the exams without literally learning all of the details and processes (which are deemed uncool) yourself. This is made more difficult by the fact that he's thrown out all of the previous relatively well-structured course material, replacing it with his free-form, tangent-filled lectures, with no useful slides or notes posted. 

Logistics is a nightmare. Completely unreliable and disorganized. Difficult to get in touch with and has yet to timely follow through (if at all) on a single assurance he's made all semester when you do. Hasn't bothered to figure out the most basic software used for the course, making things even worse for students in every way (exams, projects, recordings, notes, slides).

Even if we end up with an insane curve to make up for his incompetence (which seems to be the case from the first exam), we've been taught little in a potentially fascinating course and have been enormously stressed and frustrated.",1,B+,2022-11-13T07:50:29.054960Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Horrible teacher. He fails at not only teaching but also responding to relevant questions. His lectures are more about his personal life than it is about data science, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time by even attending the lectures. The fact that he had to curve an exam by >30% in a class that's not even meant to be difficult speaks volumes. As much as I'd like to say he's a good person but bad professor, I'm afraid to say an irresponsible professor is not exactly the best person.

If you're reading this, kindly teach relevant information. As much as some members of the class enjoy your tangents, I (and many others) came here to learn and nothing else. Please teach in a practical and planned manner. I loathe those who are fortunate enough to not value over 90 minutes of time.

To reiterate, if you are reading this: Students come here to learn data science. You are obviously a talented and tested individual, and clearly possess the capability of teaching. I can only assume you think we don't take this course seriously, and therefore neither should you.",1,A,2022-11-13T08:14:53.062387Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Absolutely horrid professor and class. If you take this class get prepared to teach yourself all the material related to any assignment or quiz. He has no comprehension of what it's like to be a student in his class where he handwaves every topic briefly with no reinforcement and then assigns us projects where it is NOT RELATED AT ALL to what he is teaching. He is more concerned with his job at EBay than he is with actually being a good professor and to compensate for this just showers the class in extra credit (which does not make him a better professor). Overall, horrible professor. If you enjoy learning any actual material don't take a class with him. You will regret it.",1,W,2022-11-14T19:04:47.952638Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"READ! This semester was his first time teaching and he caused a blunder with the midterm, which wasn't even that bad in my opinion. That's the only reason a bunch of nutcases spammed him with 1-star reviews. Anyway, he curved very reasonably and is set on not repeating his mistake. Aside from this, he consistently enlightens us about the Data Science industry and teaches us useful concepts relevant to the industry. His lectures are fun to go to! Additionally, he listens. He's always asking for feedback and genuinely feels bad for the mistakes he has caused. You study for exams (both online) by following a well-written study guide he provides. Regarding projects, they are also fun and you learn applicable Data Science skills. There's no final exam, but instead, a final project where you can make what you want to while fulfilling certain requirements. Max is super lenient with your ideas and is super easy to talk to. If you're uneasy because of his reviews, just go talk to him and decide for yourself.",5,A+,2022-11-15T03:19:02.930628Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Honestly, ignore the 1-star reviews. He has a 5 star on ratemyprofessor out of 30 ratings. It's from UMBC and it's the same Max, I checked his LinkedIn. I can guarantee the 1-star reviewers are all nerds.

Max is hilarious, makes lectures fun, and teaches valuable course material. People are mad because ""what he says in lecture doesn't help us with the projects"", yea, it doesn't. That is a common occurrence for higher-level CMSC courses. I guess none of those reviewers have gotten past CMSC351/CMSC330 yet.  Projects involve using code to extract text from websites, organizing it, and making graphs/visualizations out of the data to make a point. Do people actually expect Max to stand there for 90 minutes every lecture teaching us how to code in pandas? He showed us the basics then everything else builds on that. Making a pretty visualization is something google helps you with. I do think Max should provide us with documents with code examples relevant to the projects outside of lecture, which is something he currently does not do, otherwise I don't mind his teaching.

Max also uses his experience from working in the field to teach us and explain what is and is not relevant. I love knowing what topics are actually used in the field because I want to work in data science. Knowing what to expect means I can focus on certain topics more and do better on interviews. Everyone that is roasting Max for talking about his work in the field is an absolute donut that just wants to be spoon-fed code instead of learning topics at a high level and figuring out the code on their own. 

Max is also a very considerate and reasonable instructor that understands that students have a life outside of his class and is willing to accommodate for special circumstances. Very down to earth and likable dude",5,B+,2022-11-19T05:07:36.690991Z

Nice guy, would love to get a beer with him some time but the course is so disorganized to the point where it makes learning horrible. He was adamant on changing the slides in the beginning of the year because they ""weren't good"" and now instead teaches off whatever tangents his brain works off of. I can't imagine how Jose feels as he recently revamped the course just to have it ruined by Max.

Other than that, he's a cool guy and completely understanding/willing to take feedback. The 1-star reviewers are all crybaby's and think everything they need to know for this class needs to be spoon-fed to them like a little child. People even tried to take advantage of his kindness claiming the stat questions on the midterm shouldn't count because STAT400 isn't a prerequisite for this class.

If you want to pay a lot of tuition and gain the ability to be a self-learner, take this course with Max. Although Max is a nice professor, who likes talking about his success in the industry, this course is so unorganized and that is because he removed all the good slides from the previous semesters and wants to teach this course in his own way.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Ill break it down for everyone as best as I can.
Cons: 
- No lecture slides
- He has lecture notes he wrote, but only sometimes do they get posted
- The first midterm was a mess. He put a huge curve on it to make up for it though. 
- Not many code examples
Pros: 
- Relatable nerdy guy with stories from the industry (he is not a professional professor, he is data scientist with an insanly good resume) 
- Willing to do better as a professor, the first exam was a mess, the second one was not. If someone did bad on the second exam it was probably because they did nothing all semester. 
- Gives warm-up questions at the start of lectures which he describes as interview problems 

All in all, he is not the worst professor. The projects are related to the materials despite what some other peoples reviews are saying. The exam questions were related to the lectures, despite what some other reviews are saying. Do the projects require a lot of Googling? Yes, they do. There were not too many code examples given in the course but the documentation surronding what you are doing is actually really good. So, having to Google it, is not like shooting yourself in the foot. 

I'd say 4/5. There is room for improvement, but it could of been way worse. 

I found it was best to skip the in-person lecture as watching the recording of the lecture made taking notes easier as the lectures are actually him just talking to you and not reading off a slide show. So if you cannot take notes based on speech in a quick manner like myself, watch the recordings.",4,A-,2022-12-06T16:27:47.068295Z

He has a lot of experience in the field so he makes sure to focus on the things that people will need to be successful in their careers. He also gave lectures on important skills that aren't taught in Computer Science like ethics and how to talk to people. He makes the class feel like a safe space for everyone and is very accommodating.

His first test was very disorganized but he gave lots of extra credit to make up for it and worked things out with people who had problems on top of that. The second test was a lot better and he still let people talk him into extra credit for certain questions. The final project is one that will look good to employers and replaces any final test. There are 4 projects in the class that can take a bit of time to complete if you don't understand the tools but once you know how to use the them the projects don't take long at all.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Maks is a fun lecturer, as a data scientist who had worked in the industry he shared a lot of interesting stories relating to his experience with past jobs. However the class itself is disorganized, you have to rely heavily on the notes you take during class as he doesn't consistently have official class notes, and the exams didn't have any official practice questions other than student-made ones posted on Piazza. The projects rely heavily on your ability to google the right things as there's not much in the lectures dedicated on teaching students how to use Python other than a few mentions of some random Python methods here and there.
As this is his first semester teaching here he is willing to improve, he does listen to students' feedback. His second exam was much more fair and comprehensive compared to his first exam.",4,B+,2022-12-13T18:51:14.984925Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"So here's the thing - I don't think the 1-star grades are fair. Maks first and foremost is a genuinely nice person - this goes a long way. The only real issue with the class is the material covered in class is pretty orthogonal to the exams from what I understand

320 also has a reputation of being a very chill class so the departure from this I think makes a lot the ratings (unfairly in some sense) lower - he's a new professor and I truly think he wants everyone to do well.
Also just wanted to point out that the claim in an earlier review that the class material not corresponding with the tests/projects is common in upper level classes is completely wrong. I've taken 6 or 7 (I can't remember) 400 level CS courses - this has never been the case.

He doesn't really have any lecture notes, so sometimes it is hard to follow and know what is and isn't important in lecture. The only exam practice that is given are practice problems created by other students in the class, which is nice practice but gives you no direction about what you actually need to know for exams. He does curve exams pretty generously. He rarely answers Piazza posts, which can be pretty frustrating especially when questions that are asked days before projects are due are never answered. I feel like what we learn in class isn't super helpful with the projects, and I usually spend more time googling than I do coding. It's not too difficult to do well in this class, but unfortunately I don't feel like I have learned a ton.

- He redid the CMSC320 curriculum in the beginning of the semester, but relevant lecture slides/notes and recordings sometimes weren't posted until weeks later 
- Projects and class material didn't really line up 
- The first exam had a really low average which led Maks to curve our grades (by a LOT). Second exam went by much better. We also had an opportunity for extra credit for each exam (posting an exam question on Piazza).
- No real practice exams or questions (outside of the questions posted for extra credit)
- He has prior knowledge working as a Data Scientist for places like Google and Ebay and tells us about his experiences there
- Grading is kind of slow -- 2/4 of the mini-projects still aren't graded (and one was turned in around a month ago)
- Googling is an important skill to have
- Maks is open to feedback, willing to improve, answers questions, will offer advice and ways to improve, and cares about his students

The biggest thing is that he's always willing to make up for things he's made mistakes with. He curved generously when the exams went (on average) poorly. I did abysmally on the first exam (failed it even after a 15% curve), because the class is harder with Max than it seems to have been with some other professors. The final project was interesting and topic selection was lenient (although grades took a while). I ended up with needing about 0.01% to get an A- and I emailed Max asking if he would round me up. He graciously rounded me all the way to an A (approximately a 3-4% bump iirc). 

Ultimately, you shouldn't *not* take a class because it's with Max.

There weren't any slides which sucks. Averages on the Kruskal written exams were like in the mid to low 60s, but gave strong curves obviously. Great man, improving professor with lots of potential.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"i've never had a teacher more open to feedback and thoughts than him. honestly the class kinda sucked but he clearly cares about the students and what their opinions are on everything going on. he always seems to try and do his best to figure out how to make us feel better and have a good experience in class (even tho again, class sucked but like hes a nice fella). it's a good enough reason alone to take him just cuz of how nice he is. he also curves very generously because of how aware he is that this class kinda sucks. 
his lectures felt pretty all over the place. he's a very engaging speaker and tries to make the class interactive so you wont be bored and your brain will be moving during it but most people i know and i primarily learned from kruskal's videos rather than maks' class just because of how messy it'd be sometimes. he'd get terms/content wrong and correct himself a lecture later, change up variables, explain things incorrectly, etc. it's probably just cuz he just started teaching here tho, he'll probably have  a much better grasp of the content and how to teach it by like a semester or two. it definitely felt like he didn't rehearse or think much abt how to convey new information, but again, he'll probably be good with time.  
honestly more of a 3.5/5 stars with my specific experience in this course but he'll def be like a 4 or 5 in a few semesters. i rounded up since he's jus a nice guy lol some people on here are too mean. pretty sure he reads these too",4,,2023-05-11T05:00:56.351623Z

His lectures didn't prepare us for Kruskal's midterms or homeworks, but then again, Kruskal is really specific in what he wants (I still do not understand why we had to know how to calculate the exact number of comparisons for each algorithm) and I doubt anyone can really teach 351 at the level Dr Kruskal does. It also takes WAY too long to get a homework back (they've actually got 320 TAs grading 351). Overall though, I think Max tried really hard, and he's giving us a generous curve, and he's still new.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Co-taught with kruskal, so I'll ignore many of the issues that come with his content

Pros:
- Super caring about students. He recognized that Kruskal runs a brutal class, and heavily curved and gave us hints for exams to make up for it
- He cares heavily about his assignments and their grades accurately reflecting the knowledge of his students. Since Kruskal's content doesn't do that, he put a lot of effort into making sure nobody failed the class unless they were extremely under the average. He went as far as to curve the average for the entire class up to an A at the end.

Cons:
- Severe lack of knowledge of the subject. Everything I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures
- Very disorganized. Didn't prepare for lectures, and basically tried to learn the content along with us

Definitely has potential to be an excellent professor when he makes his own content and lectures about stuff he knows about. Unfortunately, this semester was neither. I'm giving him a 4/5 for his extreme willingness to de-Kruskal the class by any means necessary.",4,A,2023-05-17T16:29:24.318955Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I wanna cut Maks some slack. It was his first semester co-teaching 351 with Dr. Kruskal.
Overall, it seemed that he didn't have much control over the course structure/material since it was his first time teaching. All decisions were ultimately up to Dr. Kruskal. 
I don't know the extent that Maks had over the HWs and Exams that were given to us. They all felt as though they were made by Dr. Kruskal.
The HWs and exams were insanely challenging. Averages for both midterms seemed to be around ~60%.

During lectures he taught us based on Dr. Kruskal's recorded lectures from previous semesters. Maks' lectures were very high-level though, so I still had to watch Dr.Kruskals lecture videos to know the full extent of the material and all the deeper math theory behind specific algorithms.

Hopefully, I can make it through this course with a passing grade. As of right now, right after our final, nobody can tell what their grades will be.
Maks has potential to be great though! He genuinely cares about his students and relates to us. So he understands the struggles and stress everybody went through this semester. I'm excited to see how he ends up structuring his course for semesters to come. He has the same teaching knowledge as Dr. Kruskal now, so he might be continuing the same curriculum but in his own revised way. Which I can say is definitely useful and important to know! I can definintely say I'm coming out of this course knowing the deeper math fundamentals behind algorithms. So take it with him if you want to learn a lot!",4,P,2023-05-17T21:22:22.779626Z

For this course especially, it's easy to tell that he did not have much control over the course since he was co-teaching with kruskal, so a lot of the course's clumsiness can be attributed to that. But he's a much-needed breath of sympathetic fresh air in the CS department, and it's clear he cares a lot about the well-being of his students. He has everything he needs to become a great professor, just give the lad some time. And while he's still figuring things out he's never blamed his students for any resulting grade discrepancies and reassesses accordingly.

The exams are very open ended, sometimes weirdly or vaguely worded, and generally just harder then they should be. The class material only really prepares you for the exams if his exact way of teaching works for you, and for most people it doesn't. Everything else in the class is graded very generously though.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is definitely not your standard CS professor, but do yourself a favor and take him anyways. You’ll leave this class feeling like you have a better understanding of what data science actually is, rather than a random assortment of knowledge that you have to regurgitate on exams to get an A(which is what a lot of CS classes are). On top of that, I’m almost certain he’s the nicest person in this department. He’s very understanding of the fact that we’re all stressed out college students, so he’s chill with deadlines as long as you reach out to him. He’s also a huge nerd and is incredibly funny. I found myself laughing constantly throughout his lectures(go to lecture, they’re fun). Also, go to his office hours or set up a meeting with him. This man has a lot of experience in industry, he’s well connected, and he’s a very approachable guy who wants to help everyone be the best version of themselves. You’re missing out if you don’t talk to him.
He’s not perfect. He sometimes makes promises he doesn’t keep, he doesn’t really have practice questions for exams, and it often seems like he put the lecture together the night before and hoped for the best. BUT he made up for everything and was willing to change his course policy any time we had an issue with something.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"An interesting, caring, and potentially great professor. This was his first semester teaching CMSC351, and he was co-teaching with Kruskal; so the semester was, as expected, brutal. However, he did genuinely try his best to accommodate the students.
Pros:
- Incredibly welcoming and lovely person: if you want advice, talk to someone openly, or review lecture contents, then come to his office. 
- Engaging and interactive: the lectures became more interesting (but it was a bit time-consuming, so he might not go over everything he needed to teach and told us to watch Kruskal's lectures)
- Understanding: Max curves the final grade generously, especially if you show efforts, such as coming to office hours for help consistently or showing up to class and participating in lectures, then he will most likely bump up your missing 1%.
Cons:
- Disorganized. Most of the contents I learned from this class were from Kruskal's videos and online resources. I hope Max could become more familiar with the topics over the summer and incorporate a structured approach to teaching in the future. For example, Max, if you're reading this, it would be helpful to have slides containing important notes for the class. While it's great to work through examples during the lecture, including them in the slides would save time (color-coded and animated). It would be ideal if the slides could be shared before or after the lecture.
- Exams. Just terrifying. Well, it's not Max's fault because Kruskal wrote them, but my midterms haunted me. 
- Grading. It was really slow this semester due to the complications with the TAs; but it will improve, hopefully.
Advices:
- If Kruskal is going to write the exams for Max's classes, then study the homework religiously. There were practice exams, but not really helpful. You should still do it for extra practices, but mostly focus on the homework of all the topics that would appear on the exam. 
- Go to office hours. The schedule needs improvement, but it's helpful.
- Study group. Yep! Teach each other and review together.",5,B,2023-05-25T23:43:08.634085Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Honestly it's kinda hard for me to fairly review Max given the class was co-taught with Kruskal but I'm doing it regardless to help people who may consider taking him.

Max is very genuine, caring and makes lectures engaging but his knowledge was shaky (for 351 at least).  His curves are also very generous so if you're interested in getting a good grade, having a nice professor, and don't want lectures to be boring you may like him. If you want to learn at a very deep level and don't mind sacrificing a good grade, Kruskal is for you. The class in general was very unorganized but both Max and Kruskal have that sort of history but unlike Kruskal, Max is new and seeking to improve. 

Down the line I can definitely see Max being one of the more favored professors but I think he is just having a rough start since he is still new. Ideally I would want to give a 5 star but the class was just so poorly run I cannot despite it might being Kruskal's fault.",4,C-,2023-05-26T01:40:04.817074Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"351 with Max was a beautiful disaster. 

First, the review of the class: Max co-taught with Kruskal since this was his first semester teaching 351. As a result, we got all of Kruskal’s exams and homework assignments which are notoriously difficult. Max did not have control over what was being taught and the difficulty of assessments since Kruskal was in charge, and as a result, he sometimes stumbled over content (it’s hard to keep up with a mad scientist). It honestly seems like Kruskal and Max hate each other (understandably so) since there was a lot of miscommunication throughout the semester. To pass this class, this is what I did: I showed up to Max’s lecture with the expectation of getting a simplified overview. I did have to supplement the content to keep up: Kruskal has pre-recorded videos that go into the content in depth, and I binge watched those videos and reviewed the homework’s a few days before the exams. The exams feel similar to the homework assignments, but at the same time they are different, so it felt like a big wildcard, and I found it better to just YOLO the exams than to stress about them. My mantra: take inspiration from the homework assignments and express your creativity on the exams. I had no idea what I was doing on any of the exams, but try to grab the “easy” points and think on your feet. 

Max as a lecturer: he’s naturally charismatic and has a geeky sense of humor. I feel like he genuinely wants the class to pass. Even though at times Max was confused, at least he was enthusiastic while being confused? He would drop hints about the exam topics during the review which was helpful to dial in on, and his encouragement to keep us going while we were all flopping was helpful. At the end of the semester, his cutoffs were a lot more generous than Kruskal’s. For example, Kruskal’s version of an A- was an 80.5% while Max’s version of an A- was 69%. 

TLDR: if Max ever teaches 351 with Kruskal again, take it with Max and hang on for dear life.",5,A-,2023-05-28T18:30:51.198350Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max is a great person, but maybe not the best professor when it comes to co-teaching with Kruskal. This is after-all because Kruskal is Kruskal. This was not worth the hours of stress that this class put me through (especially the final) because the exam structure itself was impossible (Kruskal said the average should be around 65%) and the major delay in grades. This saying this course is mainly a rant against the way Kruskal structured it, Max didn't have much say over the structure or content. He gave us a large curve, but this also was probably the worst class I've taken with the CS department (but its because of Kruskal not Max). In conclusion, Kruskal is the villain and Max was forced to join the dark side.",3,B-,2023-05-29T01:05:15.660070Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Maksym's 351 was co-taught with Kruskal, and this whole class was basically run as Kruskal's class with Kruskal's homeworks and exams. Max was forced to co-teach with Kruskal, in which Max was not very happy with as far as I know, because Max had little to no control over the material. Kruskal and Max were both discontent at each other, because Max didn't want to follow what Kruskal does.

I think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you really understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last ""coding interview"" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode medium without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these ""interview"" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing you whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.

Now, onto Max. Like I said, Max wanted to go with Justin's material to teach his class, so him being forced to follow Kruskal's material was probably stressful for him. I'll give him credit for trying his best. He's definitely someone who wants his students to pass the class, although that is not evident in his teaching, but in the curve. He gave a lot more substantial curve than Kruskal's even when Kruskal's curve was pretty large, which was about one letter grade difference, although the pass/fail cutoff was comparable for both of them. Does Max teach well? Well, that's another matter.

I think the problem with Max is that he severely lacks knowledge on the material. It's not that Kruskal's material is different from Justin's or whatever, he just doesn't know the subject well enough to lecture it. I'm sure Max is very competent when it comes to an actual practice as an engineer given his career, but I think his teaching is very shallow, although he has potential to improve. I definitely think Max wants to become the next Justin, someone who is approachable to his students, explains the concepts well, and have the majority of his students get an A. The thing is, I barely learned anything from Max's lectures. Pretty much the entire knowledge I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures and his office hours. The difference in the level of quality in answers you get from Kruskal's office hours and Max's office hours is pretty significant. I definitely think that Max will improve a lot, but I can't say that I learned a lot from him.

Despite the co-teaching, there is a pretty huge difference in the philosophy of teaching 351 between Kruskal and Max. Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. The way Max seemingly wanted to run this class is like a standard class, where you just take notes and you can do well on the exam just from the rote memorization. The difference in the philosophy of the subject is probably why Max and Kruskal were so unhappy with each other. I personally think that critical thinking and understanding is much more crucial rather than simple regurgitation when it comes to algorithm and theory. This is probably why I learned a lot more from Kruskal and give him more credit than Max. But I think Max has a lot of potential and I definitely do see Max as a good lecturer in a few years.

One thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured and Max did his best for his first semester teaching it. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools, so I can definitely feel Max's frustration in having to be forced to teach that way only. But then again, the whole CS curriculum at UMD needs some fixing.",3,A+,2023-05-29T09:35:11.381315Z

We have a weekly problem set (which I believe are written by the TAs) which are often filled with unclear questions and/or typos. These problem sets take the instructors weeks, and sometimes months, to grade. On both midterms, we were tested on concepts that we had never actually been graded on yet since we were still waiting to get our submissions back.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Easily my favorite professor I've had at umd, and made me want to go into data science. The class is a bit disorganized, but exams and homework are pretty fair. Max has the only lecture that I actually looked forward to attending, he has so much knowledge to share about the actual industry (he's worked at google, ebay, etc), he's super chill and understanding of students, and a super entertaining dude. Can't speak for any of his other classes but 100% recommend taking 320 with him, class has been pretty easy. Definitely goat potential",5,A-,2023-12-11T23:12:04.925087Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Lowkey I love Max. I understand the criticisms, but if you go to class, pay attention, and just try your best on exams its really really easy to get an A. Just take a look at his grade distribution. He really prioritizes students learning, which sometimes comes across as not caring about grades. Just have faith and wait for the curve.",5,A,2023-12-12T18:48:01.620298Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Max is a nice guy with decent career advice and industry knowledge and that's about it when it comes to his teaching. While his projects were insanely easy, they in no way prepared you for his exams. He expects people to have a deep understanding of the content but doesn't realize that to get to that point of deep understanding you need quality practice material and assignments that build up your knowledge. The lectures are incredibly surface level and showing up to class is a big waste of time, I found it hard to separate the word vomit/tangents from the important content. I didn't feel like I learned much in this class besides how to Google. Overall, I would recommend taking a different professor.",1,A-,2023-12-14T06:27:25.194132Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Honestly, Max is not too bad as a professor. I have to admit that he wasn't my first choice for 250 because Kline was rated better, but I had to take him because of course conflicts. 
Take him. It's a easy course. Most of it is common sense. Sure, you'll be introduced to new stuff, but with Max it was pretty easy as a course. I saw my friends struggle with Telli and Kline, but I studied for about 7 hrs before each of Max's exams(including the final) and I did pretty well on all of them. Homeworks are graded extensively and we have discussion worksheets that are graded which I didn't love but overall he's fine.

Rocky start, but he's been learning to teach better and get more organized (in the first few classes he didn't even get the name of the course right) but now he makes powerpoints and goes over everything; it's good enough honestly. Make sure to read Justin's notes which are online because his whole structure was based on it. Good luck!",4,A,2023-12-14T23:20:32.056176Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max is understanding and approachable, but I don't know if I would suggest taking one of his classes (or at least this class) based on his teaching style. Throughout the semester lectures were disorganized (got a little bit better towards the end, but still weren't great), and he would sometimes leave gaps in the steps of a problem/not do some problems since they were ""too annoying"" (but we would have to know how to do them). This semester, the class weights were 40% homework, 10% lab worksheets, 30% midterms (2 midterms), and 20% final. The homework problems were difficult, but you were able to get most done on your own (you have at least a week to do each of them) and if you had any questions about any of the problems you could go to office hours and the TAs would help you understand them better. The worksheets were every Wednesday and they were done in discussion (some TAs would go over how to do the problems, but mine didn't) and they were graded on completion. The midterms were fine for the most part, but on both midterms, there was a problem where very few people got them completely right (e.g only 5-10% of people got full credit for them) so your exam grade basically dropped a letter grade just from that one problem (on the first midterm that problem ended up getting dropped, but it was a special circumstance). Max also taught using Justin's notes (so you could have chosen to not attend lectures). 

I feel like the class would have been a lot better if Max learned the material ahead of time and planned the course in a way that would work for him (instead of using Justin's notes, there are pros and cons to not using Justin's notes though). I felt like he was learning the material/what he was teaching the day of or the night before the lecture because he often made mistakes when explaining/doing the problems in the lecture. I also felt like the class was being run by the TAs and Max (and this isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it felt like the TAs would tell him often what to do and what not to do.

I was going to give Max a higher rating, but the following reasons are why I didn't. The final was more challenging than the midterms and I would almost go as far as saying that some of the problems on the final were as hard as the homework problems. I also felt like there was a problem on the final that was just straight-up, not possible (maybe it's a skill issue, but it didn't seem possible to do based on what the question was asking). This leads me to another issue that I have with the class. Almost all homework assignments/review sheets that we had in the class had typos which is frustrating (since some problems are either impossible/completely different even with a slight change in wording). I will say that most typos were noticed and fixed quickly, but I don't think it should happen that often (this is a red flag for me because if typos happen that often are they reading/doing the problems beforehand?).

Max is a 10/10 person, but a 3/10 teacher in my opinion.",2,A-,2023-12-16T01:24:29.071328Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Class is just a mess. Grading takes forever (Homework due late October still is not back yet) and Prof. Morawski doesn't seem to really care about that. Our final project was released extremely late and last homework was also released really late. Barely any communication about this. The last homework was released so late that we were basically expected to work on it over Thanksgiving break, when it was originally supposed to be due 2 weeks before break. None of the homework is that hard (IMO at least) but it's just annoying that you continuously have to check up to see if the professor has even released the homeworks when he's already behind schedule. 

Prof. Morawski also is just bad at teaching, plain and simple. Lectures seemed more like a stand up routine to him. As other reviewers said, the slides have minimal info, and equations are often wrong. There's no clear definitions for anything, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everything is taught in an example/high level way but you are expected to understand and replicate at a low detailed level. For example, with hypothesis tests, you will not find detailed definitions in the slides that include everything he wants you to know. You have to google these things or use the other prof's slides. This is kind of insane to me as Prof. Morawski has taught this class MULTIPLE times before. And, you can tell that he thinks his teaching style is superior to other professors, which is frankly hilarious as he also goes on about how he thinks he didn't explain things well or how the exams he wrote/gave us are bad exams.

Homeworks and projects always needed numerous corrections-- again, kind of ridiculous for a professor who has taught this class before. Good luck starting the homework early, because he will probably change multiple things in the first few days of homework release. 

Exams had questions where you were supposed to use your ""real world brain"" and think outside the box. What does this actually mean? Trick questions and ones that are long/confusingly worded for no reason. We had some tricky questions on things that he *explicitly* did not teach us previously due to cancelling class multiple times or having the other prof teach us for a class. I understand that he had to cancel class for personal issues, but I didn't think it was fair to have tough questions on concepts that he himself did not teach us.

Anyway, all of the below reviews are very accurate as to how you will feel about Prof. Morawksi. You will either be mildly irritated at his lack of organization and general lecture style, or you will become part of his fan club. No in between. You will not feel neutral about him.",1,A-,2023-12-16T20:15:56.602513Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"While Max himself is a great person, very funny professor, and super engaging, I'm not sure many people in the class enjoyed his teaching style and I'd recommend not taking him for CMSC250. Most of his lectures were incredibly unorganized, and his notes were never uploaded on time. He posted Justin's notes which helped a lot more than his own notes, so I guess that helped. There was very unclear communication between students and TAs about grades on homework and discussions, and most grades were entered after the exams that covered them. Fortunately I figured out most of the content on my own, but Max's lectures didn't really help much at all. I would try to take another professor if you could.",2,A,2023-12-18T02:32:54.689059Z

He doesn't want the education to continue the way it is, where students can just cram for an exam and then forget about it. This leads to harder exams. Get over it. If you wanna take the easy way out take another major. If you go to class and PAY ATTENTION he shares useful information and knowledgeable insight to his experiences in the industry. My only complaint is his slides are pretty bad, but luckily he's coteaching with Fardina who has pretty excellent slides so as I study for the final I will be going off her slides. They are just more detailed. He should improve his slides because with just his slides it hard to know whats going on. If you care about learning and are interested in Data Science take Max.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I thought this was the first time he was teaching this course (F23) so I was willing to excuse disorganization. Seeing as he's already done this before, this semester was inexcusable. If there is another professor available, take 320 with them. The class final project was somewhat of an afterthought and was just a 15% of your grade homework tacked on the end of the semester. It was Doctor Fardina's first time teaching the course, yet she put together a much better experience over the semester (specifically the last two exams: much higher average score on midterm 2 and allowed a formula sheet on the final/was very clear about what topics to review).",1,B,2023-12-19T18:40:50.195141Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"TLDR: low-medium workload. Avoid him if you just want to get through 250 as painlessly as possible, take him if you don't mind dealing with a bit of BS for a fun and memorable professor. 
One common thread you'll see throughout Max's reviews is that the class is pretty disorganized, that held pretty true this semester too. He frequently made simple mistakes during lectures, had practice problems that were wrong or incomplete, and on occasion something on a homework or exam pops out way harder than it was supposed to. Grading speed was also a big issue, although the homeworks were much harder than the rest of the class/exams. I can see if you just want a straightforward professor who posts all their notes nice and neat, is consistent with teaching, and is generally predictable why you would not like Max. If, however, you commit to going to class and can deal with a little BS, you'll find him a very memorable professor who had the class bursting in applause for anything from getting basic arithmetic right to designating an entire exam problem extra credit. I genuinely enjoyed my time in the lecture, even through all the hiccups. If that's something you can see yourself doing, give him a try.",5,,2023-12-19T20:36:31.588882Z

This is my second course with Max, and the disorganization has definitely improved, but is still pretty bad. Regardless, it's clear that he LOVES this class, and he's incredibly knowledgeable on the subject (has industry experience at Google and some startups). Would definitely recommend if you can put up with the long wait time for grades to come in, and the generally disorganized course structure.",4,A,2023-12-22T16:35:20.998825Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max is pretty mediocre, but an entertaining guy and his class isn't difficult. His lectures are somewhat poorly structured and he frequently makes mistakes while lecturing. Occasionally he'll admit he's not well-versed in what he's teaching at the moment. He often changes course policies at the whims of the TAs, which can be frustrating as students never know exactly what to expect. Overall the class isn't run very well. 

Moving on to his positives, he gives out weekly homework which is great practice material but not too difficult. There are lots of helpful third-party resources given to students so it's hard to get lost or fall behind. The midterm exams were both fair and easy, and the first one was curved up significantly. The final was long and difficult but had a heavy curve, I personally got above a 100 after the curve. 

Max is fine. Take him if there aren't better options available. 250 isn't a hard class, but with Max you'll have to put in most of the effort yourself to succeed. I think he has room to improve into a good prof if he puts more effort into class organization and consistency.",2,A,2023-12-22T22:36:51.727084Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,Nice guy but going to his class is useless because you can just get all the information needed from Fardinas slides and online. He writes nothing on his slides and doesn't post his recorded lectures unless you ask. The coding assignments weren't bad but to get full points you have to do more than what the directions are asking. He grades kinda easy and there are multiple opportunities to get extra credit.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Overall, I think Max made data science my favorite course that I've taken here at UMD. There are still truths to some complaints here, but the positives are still far greater than the negatives and the way it's taught is so unique so I think people should still take this class with Max (or at least go to his 320 lectures when they happen, since they're quite interesting, humorous, and thought provoking).
First, the cons: Yes, the class was quite disorganized, we had an assignment due in October that wasn't graded until the last day of finals. Some problems were unclear or needed us to search up information on our own (but this research was very simple and not really an issue). He is unprepared sometimes; he mentioned some lectures went way faster than expected, or will forget to put something very important on slides, and also stopped posting recordings for lectures which made it a bit hard to study for exams. Additionally, he isn't the best at math, so he'll sometimes make mistakes on some slides or formulas, but in practice we hardly used formulas so this hardly disrupted the flow of the class. In terms of grades, the other section for Fall 2023 (with Fardina) was basically a guaranteed A (the average on Max's exams was about 77%, Fardina's average on exams was about 92%) so honestly, if grade is the [only] thing you care about, maybe you should take it with Fardina based on the stats.
But Max's section and thoughts have many positives: The overall grade for the regular assignments and final project (which were worth 55% of the class) was at 95% so no one really risked failing the class, and most of these took just around 2-4 hours to complete since there are lots of guides to do what was asked. Where Max really shines is in his lectures: they were the most consistently engaging ones that I've been through at the university, always getting people to ask questions, cracking jokes and being relatable on what being in CS is like. The way he teaches the course isn't just learning data science in how to design & execute an experiment, because he also notes where it's relevant and useful (he mentions how Goodhart's law is seen in practice through grade inflation, I wonder where this could be present...), what the industry currently uses in practice (how does Netflix or Amazon actually recommend things), and bringing his own industry experience to elaborate on what we would do working in data science. Additionally, he also goes on some important side tangents about other important topics, like critically thinking about what grades are, career advice and thinking about interviews, how to ingest ethics in practice, and other considerations in life that many other professors don't touch (he informally holds a group of people that learn more on these general life skills). In the end, the class is such a unique, refreshing, and positive experience that I'd advise everyone that can take 320 to take Max's section when he teaches it.",5,A,2023-12-23T17:24:34.998525Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I would not recommend him for this class at all. I had quite a bit of experience going into this class and as other reviews mention, it TRULY is disastrously organised. His slides were too minimal, and he would/could not explain concepts clearly (which he acknowledged) and then we'd be tested on minute details about those very concepts! His ""review guides"" would tell us we'd be tested on some topic, and that topic would never show up on the exam! He actually prides himself on his ""quirks"" but it's super annoying because it's too specific and not relevant. His office hours are also always filled with the same people chatting away so it's hard to ask him questions. I had him for 351 and I thought this course would be better but it's about the same. I don't think I learnt anything from him in either course.

He'll tell you cool stories about his time in the industry and that will usually be enough to distract you from the real problem that he doesn't know the content well enough to teach it. NEVER TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM!",1,B+,2023-12-24T02:12:21.423126Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I had Max for 320 this semester (Fall 2023) and 351 last semester (Spring 2023), and all I can say is that he is a great lecturer that genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed when they go to the industry. Many students complain that his slides are not comprehensive and that we need to google most concepts to better prepare for exams. However, I would argue that this reflects exactly what data scientists (and most CS related jobs) are doing in the industry. You are just required to have a basic understanding of class concepts, so googling stuff and learning the basics isn't really that bad. Max's style of teaching prepares the students to better navigate real-world challenges and to not be always ""spoon-fed"" with information.

Regarding the coursework, Max's exams are essentially about two things: Demonstrating basic understanding and extending the class ideas to real-world situations. I didn't study a lot for exam 1 and the final, and I got an A in both of them. If you hope that you will get an A by memorizing concepts and not actually understanding how the algorithms work and the math behind them (in a general/basic level), do not take the class with Max.  However, I must mention that Max sometimes messes up exams, where the average would be 70% or less. Though, you can always get partial credit and extra credit in all of his exams and assignments. Also, you can always email Max about anything, including bumping up your grade to the next cutoff if you think you deserve it! In general, Max's classes are easy, and you will do just fine if you attend lectures and demonstrate basic understanding in exams.",5,A,2023-12-24T23:48:40.957700Z

He promised to curve that exam and ended up curving NOTHING! Before that, he openly admitted to us that it was unfair, and it felt like everyone was depending on it. Extremely disappointed, as the overall average for Fardina's section was so much higher than ours, and as heard from that section, she was very considerate to the students' needs.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"My opinion:
He is not that bad as some of the 1-star reviews state, and also not as good as some of the 5-star reviews. He taught the class in a way that was different from what one would expect. The subjects taught in class are very simplified, so students are encouraged to do outside research on what you learn in class. The projects were really fun for me as for some of them we were free do implement them how we wanted to. On the other hand, the exams were quite difficult and required us to expand on what we have learned in class to a large extent.",3,B+,2023-12-28T15:07:39.386039Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Don't get me wrong - he's a really nice and chill professor and takes his feedback into consideration. But, he is SO DISORGANIZED and that makes his lectures difficult to follow. He also seems unprepared coming during lecture and makes a handful of mistakes throughout. He came in once claiming how he had ""looked at these problems beforehand"" and ""knows how to solve them"" but as soon as he got stuck on one, he just skipped it with an ""ah whatever"" mentality. Also, his TAs (this semester) had a lot of attitude.....

Overall, it's not the end of the world if you get him as a professor, but just know that you'll have to put in a lot of effort.",3,A-,2023-12-28T16:07:51.791882Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"The class with Max is generally straightforward, especially the programming assignments; the homework on SQL and Pandas borders on trivial, and the later assignments simply require using some Python libraries and can be completed with the help of a wealth of online tutorials. A couple assignments involve writing a report, and while they can be graded rather subjectively, it's simple enough to manage a decent grade on them with a few hours work. Our final project was released quite late, and thus was reasonably easy and minimal in time required.

The exams are designed to be open ended and make you display true conceptual understanding, as opposed to simply regurgitating material from the slides; it's not clear how effective this model was, as the averages on the first midterm were very high but were below a C for the second. Regardless, all the exams are doable if you really think about what Max is asking you to answer (rather than assuming what he is asking based on how a normal CS exam might go).

Max is prone to going on tangents while lecturing, keeping track of his idiosyncrasies can be annoying when trying to submit work that meets his standards, and his slides are wholly unhelpful; in spite of all of that, if you follow along in class and spend a few hours studying for the exams you'll be fine.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He is a quirky guy who has his funny moments but at the end of the day, is a terrible instructor and comes off as incredibly arrogant and annoying. Yes, his lectures are engaging, but for all the wrong reasons. He rambles on about his work and personal experiences but ends up teaching very little substance as a result. He takes pride in his slides for being minimal, which isn't a problem by itself. But when you combine minimal slides containing useless information and formatting and an instructor who rambles on about pointless topics the whole lecture, then it becomes a problem. 

Exams are not fair. He tells us that to do well on exams we need to have a deep level of understanding of the material and to think outside of the box, which again, isn't a problem by itself. But he never gives us practice material to achieve that, as the homeworks are super straightforward and generally unrelated in concepts to exams, and doesn't teach properly enough to expect that from us. This is evident from our exam 2 average, which was 69 percent. Comparing that to Fardina's class (the instructor he was co-teaching with), which was 86 percent, it becomes comically unfair. He also never curved because of that exam even though he said he would. He said he instead ""compensated"" by making the final a bit easier, which is funny because our final exam average was still low at 82 percent compared to Fardina's 96 percent. 

At least CMSC320 isn't too difficult conceptually, with much higher weightage on homework, and less on exams, allowing many students, including me, to barely manage to get a good grade. I just feel really bad for people who were stuck with him for CMSC250 and/or will be for CMSC351, because those are objectively two of the most conceptually difficult CS classes students will take, with high weightage on exams, and Max will do everything to make it even harder for you.",1,A,2024-01-20T07:20:29.712400Z

He's a lot more human than most professors, and is much more likely to add curves and change class circumstances based off of feedback. He is also much more of a normal person than most professors, so while he might make some mistakes in lectures, he also teaches in a way that makes the content much easier to understand.",4,A+,2024-02-26T03:29:28.672121Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Horrible teacher never take him. Bro tells us to attend different professors lectures, read their notes, and then study their practice materials but has the audacity to make his own exams when he's not capable of teaching the course.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He isn't the worst professor in the CS department, but he's close. He has told us multiple times in lectures to review other professors notes, slides, or practice problems because he isn't able to explain or define the topics clearly himself. His exams are made to be tricky and he puts leetcode style questions throughout, making the exam obnoxiously difficult for no good reason. He is a funny and good guy personally, but is very disorganized and hard to follow during lectures. I would advise taking another professor for 351 if possible.",1,C+,2024-03-13T16:47:29.388019Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max has many issues which keep him from being worth taking at all. His first issue is that he is basically a glorified substitute teacher for the better professor who is Justin Wyss-Gallifent. All Max does is rehash his notes in a worse and confusing manor. He also takes the homeworks directly from Justin, so you begin to wonder what he actually does. Then when the exams come around you find out this is the only reason he wants to teach. He likes to make his exams as difficult and unorthodox as possible. He will put questions that were not remotely covered in class as he teaches the material from Justin's notes word for word and then tests us on questions he personally likes. The other problem is he puts very little effort into it as he just generates the questions using LeetCode then lets his TA's attempt to convince him out of giving some of the terrible questions that are generated. My main issue is that there is no textbook or notes provided from Max to learn how to do these weirder questions that he asks on the exam. Maybe for example if he made his own homework instead of just giving us Justin's, then we would be better prepared for his exams. Due to this 'co-teaching', which is basically copy and paste from Justin, we are prepared for Justin's exams and not Max's exams in the slightest. I would strongly advise against taking him for any class.",1,,2024-03-14T17:25:33.327424Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I'd give this guy 0 stars if I could. His exams are insanely hard for no reason. He expects you to memorize every little minute thing that would never be useful in real life and his lectures suck. At least for cmsc351, he is teaching exactly the same content as another professor (Justin)... just worse and his exams are considerably more difficult. In the past for other classes he's tried to raise the grade requirement for the letter grades (as in an A- would be a 91 instead of a 90 and a 90 would be a B, a B- would be an 88 minimum instead of 87, etc.) and the only reason he didn't was because his TAs all organized against him doing it. He made an exam that had like 20 potential questions and his questions were so bad that the TAs ruled out 15 of them for being overly confusing and impossible to understand. He literally advises all of his students to go to the other professor's lectures and ""jokes"" about how bad of a lecturer he is. He's god awful, I genuinely cannot understate it. This man has singlehandedly caused me an insane amount of stress this semester. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",1,,2024-03-29T03:59:37.927257Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,All these poor reviews are from people who don't put in the effort this class requires. Max is a chill guy and his exams are more than fair. My only negatives would be that he messes up his notes pretty often and that he has a bit of an ego.,3,A,2024-04-08T21:40:26.536267Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I didn't think 351 with Max was very difficult. I got an 84% on the second midterm despite doing ZERO studying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (median was 79%). Still, I didn't enjoy this class because of Max's poor lecturing.

Max evidently cares little about 351, and this is reflected in his shallow lectures. This class was co-taught with Justin, and while I never attended Justin's lectures, I got the feeling that Max's lectures were simply a watered down, superficial version of Justin's lectures. As a result, I mainly relied on self-studying from Justin's notes.

Max still earns 3 stars because he is far from being a terrible professor, although I'm unsure exactly how much of my success is due to the class being co-taught by Justin. Overall, I do recommend Max as a professor.

The 3 midterms we had so far have has 3 totally different structures. Only good thing is for the midterms he gave good hints about what was gonna be asked. 
For the second and third midterm he made his own study material which helped. Maybe he's getting better as the semester progresses, but my grades are already bad due to having a hard time on what to expect. Hopefully he can improve the course in the future.",2,C,2024-04-21T19:46:18.961032Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Now if you have to take him, you'll live, but if you have any other options avoid like the plague. He's extremely disorganized, so much so that he doesn't even have a plan of what he's going to teach. Instead he goes to Justin's lectures, takes notes, and regurgitates them to us. He makes it very clear he doesn't know what he's doing. He has even admitted a few times that he didn't know how to solve some of our HW problems. His ego is extremely off-putting, he knows his exams are challenging and that we're not well prepared (both because of the lack of teaching and the lack of any type of practice materials in the format he's looking towards) but he laughs that we're frustrated with him. To put in perspective just how unpredictable his exams can be, he was going to DEDUCT points if we got a true or false question wrong because they're just ""free points"". I understand his teaching philosophy, rather than memorizing he wants us to understand things conceptually, but he doesn't have the skills to teach like that. I really wanted to like him, he can be funny at times, but most of the time he's just downright distracting and way too arrogant for his teaching style.",1,,2024-04-23T05:09:13.846392Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I seriously don't understand why Max gets so much hate and rudeness. He's a funny and engaging lecturer who has a lot of experience and down-to-earth advice about the software industry and where 351 fits in. For context, I took 351 with Max in the Spring 24 when he was co-teaching with Justin. Half the piazza posts were Max students complaining that they couldn't be in Justin's class, or just complaining about the TA's, exams, or class in general which really rubbed me the wrong way and I assume most of these reviews were written by the same people.

Trying to be as unbiased as possible, here are my pros and cons for Max:

Pros
- Funny lecturer who will often regain your attention with a well-timed f bomb
- Adapts throughout the semester based on students needs (got rid of pseudocode questions on exams)
- Him and his TAs are very responsive on piazza (shoutout Elizabeth)
- Is very understanding with questions in class
- Lots of real world/tech job searching experience (former google employee)
- Can be manipulated to give you leniency (his words not mine)

Cons
- I'd argue that exams are unpredictable, not ""hard"" like everyone says. I whiffed on his first midterm with a 70 after studying throughout the week then got a 100 on the next with only a couple hours of studying.
- Had a little trouble explaining some concepts, seemed a little unprepared to lecture on the day's topic at times

P.S. the ""leetcode question"" people are alluding to in other reviews was to code the fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming, just worded a little differently. Climbing Stairs #70 on leetcode if you want to see how ""bad"" it was.",5,A-,2024-04-25T02:42:58.617775Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"This guy bro. He ""coteaches"" with Justin, this means Justin does all the teaching and provides the textbook as well as practice exams. Max provided a single practice exam for exam3 and that too without an answer key to study off of. Then when we finally take the exam they give us barely any partial credit (also don't specify to simplify a function then take off points regardless of equivalence) and the questions were completely unrelated to the content we consumed from Justin's notes, which as some of the other reviews also mention Max told us to use and go to Justin's lectures.

I honestly have no clue how he's being paid at this point he's farming free money from the university without putting in any effort into teaching or even making the tests. Taking this class with him makes me feel bad about paying my tuition knowing any of it is going to this guy.",1,,2024-04-30T05:02:17.849440Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"I would say Max is a very lenient and chill person, as he is very understanding of any problems you have and is very receptive to feedback. Since it was his first time teaching, I would say his lecturing style was pretty disorganized and mistakes were made, but I was able to understand the main concepts in the course. I would say it is fine if you get him for 250, just be ready for some lectures to be all over the place sometimes.",4,A,2024-04-30T16:43:51.591320Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"If you were not able to take Justin, drop the class! Max doesn't even do the bare minimum when teaching, yet he goes out of his way to make exams extremely difficult. He wants to ""challenge"" you, but the execution is terrible. You go through the entire course reading Justin's notes, doing his homework, and practicing his practice exams, yet somehow you're supposed to understand the nonsense that Max puts on his exams. His exams are nothing like what you've practiced in the homework or practice exams. They're really long and theoretical based, which is basically impossible to do within 90 minutes. If you end up taking him, just know that you are not stupid. 351 is genuinely a hard course and Max just does anything he can to give you a hard time.",1,C-,2024-04-30T22:38:25.157278Z

- Exams are not hard, but are confusing
   - questions on exams test for irrelevant and unrelated material
   - rubric/point system for his exams express that you only need to get the exact answer down. Displaying a 90% understanding in the material results in 0 points.

All he does is regurgitate Justin's notes but he can't even do that well as he's always skipping over things. This honestly just show's how he's terrible at his job especially when his peers are significantly better professors.",1,B+,2024-05-02T20:24:40.360262Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Overall, Maks is a really nice person who kept lecture fun and engaging. However he was never prepared to teach the material we had to go over, often deviated from his schedule, homeworks took a long time to grade, and discussion was close to useless since the problems were so much harder than exams and TAs often did not know how to do the problems themselves. The final exam was also super tricky and ended up having to be curved. I really wish he was a better teacher because his personality and enthusiasm about the subject is great, but he does not know how to write fair exams or run a class where students understand what is being taught.",2,A-,2024-05-05T18:53:00.542423Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,idk why ppl hate on him so much! GOAT. he is someone u can talk to about anything and i get it his exams are hard but he tells u everything thats gonna be on the exam! u just need to attend his lectures thats something u wouldve done even if u had justin so not a big deal. i could be biased but this man is freakin amazing man. take him if u actually wanna learn how to solve problems cuz his exams focus more on how the algorithm performs so one never forgets what they've learned.,5,A,2024-05-06T12:23:43.288162Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"In theory Max's class should create a better learning environment because he prioritizes actually understanding the concepts at a deeper level rather then just being able to 're-run' the algorithm on a new set of numbers. However in practice the class is terrible. He is a bad lecturer that gets off topic very often and copies straight from Justins notes. He teaches the same content as Justin and has the same HW, but creates his own exams. This makes it impossible to expect what type of difficult questions we can expect on the exam.",1,B-,2024-05-07T15:20:02.762944Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"I started the semester liking Max as he seemed down-to-earth and funny. However, he quickly became arrogant and rude towards his students in a matter of weeks. He has made many jokes about how his exams are hard and he thinks it's funny that we are stressed as a result. I also went into his office hours to talk about my grade and he was super unwelcoming, basically rushing me to leave his office. 
Max puts little to no effort into this class as Justin prepares all lecture material and homeworks for him. He would often forget how to do something or explain a topic so badly that he had to pause class to reference Justin's notes. A few times, he even had to re-explain the topics during the next lecture. The one thing Max did do was write his own exams, which contained extremely hard questions and were pretty unfair based on the fact that Max students only had Justin type questions to practice with. (Justin would also give out 3-5 practice exams per midterm, while Max students would be lucky to receive a sloppy, last-minute thrown-together practice)
He has set up this class so it is extremely hard to get higher than a B-. It feels like every assignment has been graded subjectively, where graders are looking for any reason to take points from students. Max has also made it so that many of the homework and exam questions are graded all-or-nothing style with zero hope for regrades. Based on the fact that 83.3% of your grade in this course is based off of exams, exams are made based on what Max is feeling at the moment with little practice provided, and homeworks are graded as harshly as exams, Max does not have his students best interests at heart. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!",1,B-,2024-05-07T22:53:19.984087Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Not the best when it comes to fair exams (compared to Justin, for example) but I did enjoy some of his lectures. Super fun to listen to about topics that he's interested in and his exams are, while grade-destroying, very interesting to look at in hindsight. It really forces you to understand the algorithms beyond memory, at least. He's a generally understanding guy though - if you talk to him about your concerns, he'll hear you out and give good advice on what to do and how to change what your current study methods are. 
TLDR: Take Max if you really want to be pushed beyond just understanding algorithms, but don't expect fair exams or clear/concise lectures.",3,B-,2024-05-08T16:26:55.710248Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max is a very engaging professor who loves to crack jokes and is more of a casual professor than a professional professor, he's just a guy. This could be a hit or miss for some but for me personally, I liked it as it made me take the class more as a sport than a super stressful life-changing course if that makes sense. I know some people are giving him loads of backlash about difficulty or disorganization but I feel that when he was co-teaching with Kruskal it shifted his perspectives a bit, so you have to wiggle around that.

Pros, Cons, Subjectives
!! I put a * next to the important parts which heavily impacted my experience. !!

Pros:
- Very down to earth.
* - The TAs are very good! They care (shoutout to Elizabeth Qiu) and are on our side for success. She even made a Spotify playlist for studying.
* - Tells you what will be on the exam quite literally. 
- As much as it doesn't seem so, he does listen to student feedback. There was a type of question most students disliked and Max has vowed never to give a question like that again. As of today before the final, he has not given us a question like that.
- In addition to student feedback, he also interacts with his students. One of the students made a drawing of Max, and that is now his piazza profile picture.
* - If you are into his more casual style, he likes to crack jokes or give some experience
- Responsive via piazza, and also pretty interactive there.
- If he did a really bad job explaining a topic in lecture and you were unfortunate enough to be in there, Max will acknowledge this and put out a recording of the following class which he hopes is much more clear. THIS ADDS A POINT: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Cons:
* - As others said, he is very disorganized, he is still new at teaching the course.
* - If you are not into his more casual style, then you may not like him very much (or at all, he can talk a lot)
- Sometimes do not post notes, and no recordings unless you are sick. If you were to miss a topic, you will self-teach yourself (Abdul Bari is goated)
- Sometimes a review sheet is put out, but there won't be solutions, and students are forced to make an unofficial solutions page. 
- Sometimes misses his lectures and a TA teaches the lecture. Luckily, the TAs are very good! (Shoutout to Elizabeth and Lana).
* - I will say this again: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Subjective:
* - While Max is very disorganized if you were to attend the lectures then everything seems to make sense. You are punished for not going to his lecture, especially since with the point that he tells you what is in the exam in terms of the layout, and the questions it will ask, you are missing quite a lot. I encourage you to go to lecture. It is very beneficial.
* - Exams can be very hard.  I was able to get good marks on exams 2 and 3 (95%>) but failed the first exam, like bombed, destroyed, so it averages out to a C+. The first exam was on the unfair side I feel (and so did everyone else, peep the reviews from 2024) and additionally the TAs had to convince Max to not put a couple more insanely hard questions. However, for the rest of the exams, Max tries to change it up to favor us. On exam 2, there were multiple choice which tank your grade if you got just a couple wrong so in exam 3, he avoided this by giving us more small questions that gave partial even if you were not fully right. This goes towards the pro I mentioned where he listens to feedback. 
* - In addition, I felt the exams were fair. THE WAY MAX MAKES HIS EXAM IS MORE THAN MEMORIZATION (Apart from master theorem)! Max loves conceptual questions so you must understand how and why something works instead of memorizing how to do something. I eventually learned how to think this way, but others won't be as fortunate.
* - Homework can be a pain because sometimes the stuff on the homework has not been taught because for us the homework was made by Justin. I don't know how this will go when Max starts teaching it fully by himself. Find a homework group! It makes homework very doable.
- No discussion personally was a plus, but I know others prefer having discussion to discuss topics more.
- Max is a swiftie. I don't know if this is important but probably worth putting. 
- The students will complain a lot (mainly exams), and for good reasons too. However, sometimes I see people justifying their bad grades from it when really the exams are pretty alright. Max and is way of exams just may be different than what we're used to. 
* - Yes, Max likes to tell us to look at Justin's notes but only because due to his disorganization, he wants us to look at more material. Additionally, he is relearning everything also which is why he encourages it as well, just so we get correct information. This could be bad for some as it may seem like a waste of time to go to a lecture. 

I was going to give 3 stars but I am giving 4 stars because I don't think we gave him a fair chance. He is trying his best and he adjusts the exams more in our favor, but designs his exams so that cramming is not beneficial. He also gives reviews, and good reviews too personally. He and his TAs take the time to give videos and exam logistics. I appreciate Max and his TAs for doing their best. The winning aspect for me is Max feels more human. He is not professional by all means but for me that made my experience much more enjoyable (but I know most may not like this). You have to get used to his exams and his teaching style (and accept that he will be messy and disorganized).",4,C+,2024-05-12T09:27:32.842437Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He's definitely pretty bad as far as this class goes but I do feel most people are extra whiny when it comes to his class. Yes, he is a subpar lecturer in terms of his depth of knowledge on the topics and he usually goes to Justin's lecture and would attempt to replicate everything Justin did in his class but unsuccessfully. Yes, his exams are wildly inconsistent and generally more difficult than Justins (who's aren't, let's be real) who he co-taught with. However, part of the difficulty of the exams are because the HW's are all Justin's style and they don't prepare you for Max style exams. Now idk if this is his fault and if he even has the ability to interject and make sweeping changes to something like the HW but if the HW's were a little more theoretical than his exams would be easier. I had him for 250 and that class was a lot easier and smooth because you could usually redo the homework's for good exam practice. And of course, most people will cry about the infamous leetcode question that appeared on exam 1. There was enough outrage that the question ended up getting curved off and any points you got from it would be bonus points. His exams in general are very theoretical and don't allow you to rely on memorizing patterns of algorithms, unlike Justin who like any math teacher will simply change the numbers and give you the exact same problem again for an exam. I feel as though part of the issues are just the class structure because Max was fine for 250 when he could do everything his way. Frankly most professors will seem terrible when they have to stand next to Justin and teach the same class so it's not all his fault but still, he has his issues and I'd recommend to avoid",2,C+,2024-05-12T22:51:26.533796Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Took this class in Fall 2023 and it's one of my favorite CS classes I've taken. Prior to this class I had no experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, or even Python. I think a lot of the negative reviews are because Max isn't a conventional teacher, which is understandable if that's what you're looking for. However, if you believe this is a subject that you might be interested in, then I think Max is the perfect teacher for it. Compared to Fardina's class, Max was much less concerned with the math and specific details behind many of the topics we learned. What he cared about what your conceptual understanding of the topics and how you would apply them to real applications like a true data scientists would. It's certainly hard to break out of the traditional test taking mindset, however I found that the projects were a great way to learn how to apply the topics.

TLDR: Unconventional teaching style in a good way, but if you have no desire to learn data science, do not take him.",5,A-,2024-05-14T12:16:51.534424Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"The ""coteaching"" was nonexistent, but I don't think that was bad. Max teaches you a much more intuition-based course than Justin, and consequently, it's much harder to study for, which people complain about. The only thing they shared was homework, and because Max teaches differently than Justin, this certainly led to issues and reading Justin's notes to understand a question.

Other than that, I enjoyed his class. The exams were fair but difficult, and it felt like they tested my knowledge rather than inane details of the algorithms. Overall, I think Max's class is more useful in the long term because you will remember most of what he taught you, as they are vibes rather than precise answers.

Also, the Piazza was great (shoutout to Elizabeth and her quick answers).",4,B+,2024-05-15T00:08:34.285772Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Do not take Max if you can. This semester was co-taught with Justin. Sounds good, right? Well Max uses Justin's lecture notes which is fine - even if he always (and I mean always) made some mistakes in lecture. We also used Justin's homeworks, so everything seems to be great, right? Well in this class where the exams make up pretty much your entire grade, for some reason Max has decided that this is the one part of the course he wants to be original with. We get next to no preparation on the exams because all our homeworks are Justin's homeworks and while Justin generously gives his students previous semester exams to go back on and study with solutions attached, Max gave out nothing for the first exam, one practice with no solutions for exam 2 and 3, and only a review sheet for the final. It's not that I think Justin should scale back or that I'm not grateful that Max gave out at least something. It's the fact that Max's teaching does not prepare you for his exams. We learned additional topics and a different algorithm for Floyd's than Justin's class, yet the homeworks did not cover this because we were taking Justin's homeworks, and Max only uploads like half of his lecture notes for some reason. Not that his lecture notes help that much in the first place, when I look at his lecture notes I have to go and cross-reference Justin's notes if I can because Max teaches from Justin's notes most the time, yet his notes do not have in mind the fact that 90% of the things he writes is lost when reviewing them outside of lecture. I do not understand why Max insists on co-teaching with Justin just to give unique exams.

Max could've improved by realizing that it was probably detrimental to his students in create a separate exam from Justin for this semester at least. At the very least he could've put more effort into mirroring the amount of review material Justin gives, but I guess Max can do whatever he wants since at the end of the day, it is still his class. Even on the final exam Justin was very organized and gave his class the exact topics and weightings of said final exam questions, while Max on piazza said that the exam questions were ""chosen from a grab bag of the topics we've covered."" and that's pretty much all that we were given. 

I highly suggest you avoid this class with Max at all costs, or at least until Max shows improvement in understanding how to build good exams and prepare his students to excel on the exams instead of creating obscure exam questions which he thinks are interesting and expects us to do during a timed test. If you end up taking this class with Max, you will only be having a harder time. For people who do end up taking this class, whether by choice or by force, please be nice on Piazza, especially to the TA's. The TA's were here to help us do well and tried their best (remember that they are also students), yet they ended up taking most of the criticism this semester. The TA's already relayed the criticisms to the Professors, so reiterating the same critiques to the TA's did nothing and just caused more frustrations on their end. This also ended up cross contaminating with the 330 piazza which is just ultimately not ok. Max seemed to be very stubborn with how he taught the course so just save the TA's (and your time since complaining on piazza resulted in 0 change) some time and email the professor or talk to them on OH if you can.",1,,2024-05-15T00:35:42.836122Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Took him S24, when he co-taught with Justin.

So here’s the deal:
Max is nice, and he’s a decent lecturer. TAs being rough graders probably happens every semester, and it sucked

However:
- His exams have been wildly inconsistent in question style and point distribution, but overall the questions were weirdly phrased and not the kind we dealt with on the HW. The rubrics for the questions were not student-friendly. Be prepared to argue on gradescope.
- He almost got every ADS student’s final cancelled because he forgot to confirm it on time, which led to all of us scrambling over the weekend. He also once submitted an exam so late that ADS printed the previous exam and had to delay our testing by half an hour to get the right one.
- The material didn’t line up with what his co-prof taught, he didn’t record, and his notes were worthless. 

TLDR: funny and a good person, decent lecturer, but not good at the other aspects of being a professor.",3,C+,2024-05-15T13:40:29.505778Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max's lectures and notes often feel messy and incomplete in comparison to Justin's. I started off going to his lectures, and for simple topics, his lectures suffice. But for exams and most of the course material, you have to rely on Justin. My biggest grievance was like most students: from what I've gathered Max's exams were disproportionately harder than Justin's. I understand that most classes have professors who do things completely differently, but when you establish that you're co-teaching with him, I expect similarities whether it comes to exam difficulty, the method of the algorithms, notes, etc. He really wants you to understand the content on a deep level which I appreciate, but the exams punish you if you can't, and since this class is co-taught, it is kind of frustrating to hear when the neighboring professor's students are getting easier A's. Regardless though, a B and above is possible if you really grind so don't be discouraged if you're stuck with him.",2,B,2024-05-16T04:15:52.420956Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Warning: If you're looking at Spring 2024 semester reviews, you're gonna get a lot of bootlickers and people giving dramatic one-star reviews. Unfortunately they became very very vocal during the semester on Piazza and took over the entire class. So be aware when people are going overboard criticizing or praising Max.

Some people may not like his personality (not sure how to describe it, it can come off a little cocky), but he's a nice person. The issue is that his class is run like a disaster. Class notes don't get posted for months and they're fairly nonsensical to follow. He clearly makes no effort to prepare for lectures ahead of time; he made a ton of mistakes that caused lectures to contradict each other and cause a bunch of confusion unnecessarily. To add insult to injury, his UNDERGRADUATE teaching assistant taught better than him when he was absent. There were also some serious incidents involving TAs that got swept under the rug. Two TAs were straight up shit-talking students vocally and there were no repercussions except a ""hey, don't talk about that in office hours"" from him. The exams asked very vague questions that contradicted lecture material sometimes and oftentimes had multiple possible answers, but only one deemed correct. He also asked some questions about developing algorithms to solve problems. If we're going to get questions like that on exams, homework assignments or lectures should build those skills, as this is an analysis of algorithms course and it's not the main focus.

Max has his fans—I think it's great that he tries to build a community with interested students in such a large school. But I think he's emblematic of this UMD CS' institutional failures to provide consistent, quality instruction to undergraduates. That any instructor can exhibit such seemingly acute indifference to the material and helping students succeed is a total embarrassment to this university's claims of supposed high rankings and talented, accessible faculty.",2,A-,2024-05-17T00:07:17.714424Z

This makes the class significantly harder than it has to be, so I’d recommend relying on outside sources (such as Justin’s notes for 351) to learn the material. On the plus side, he is one of the more entertaining CS lecturers, his exams actually rely on applying the theory you have learned rather than memorization (some people don’t like this), and he is willing to take feedback. I’d recommend taking a different professor for most classes, but given that he has consistently improved over the two classes I’ve taken with him, he could be much better in the future.",3,A,2024-05-17T22:33:00.915074Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Ignore all these 1 star reviews, they’re probably the students that were complaining and causing drama in the course Piazza. Max is a great guy that is more personable than almost all the rest of the CS professors combined, with great knowledge about the course topics to boot. 

Sure, his class wasn’t even 40% as organized as Justin’s class, but what the people in this review section fail to realize is that Max and Justin’s exam averages were pretty similar, Justin’s averages being only 2% higher at most. The only discrepancy in this is exam 3, where which there was an 8% difference in averages, but I feel that Max recognized this and made the final exam a bit easier and more fair to compensate. Most of these reviews are complaining about a singular Leetcode problem on the first exam, which, in all regards, was unfair, but after that point, he swore to not include any more of those types of questions, or even pseudocode questions for that matter.

Max’s exams are different, in the sense that they test a lot on how well you can dissect a concept and see if you really understand it, which I think is a much better way of getting students to learn the content, as opposed to mindlessly doing problems as quickly and efficiently as possible. The people that leave reviews complaining about this are missing the point of his exams as a whole.",4,B-,2024-05-19T00:45:11.768296Z

For the final, he taught a different algorithm method from Justin, whom he was supposed to CO-TEACH with, as well as added multiple different algorithms from Justin. At that point, bro didn't even co-teach, and he made this decision in the middle of the semester which was very stressful. I am very grateful for the TAs in this class: I don't think I could've passed without them, but I can't help but think that the TAs in this class would be less stressed if Max was more organized.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He is a pretty unexperienced funny lecturer. Max took all the material from the main lecturer (Justin) and then proceeded to explain it in the way that he wanted, which was kind of sloppy at times. For instance, he would end class early because he considered there was nothing else to talk about (even though Justin's notes contained more material), he would have one of the worst handwriting I've ever seen, which did not make things easier (no offense), and he would run out of battery on his iPad in multiple occasions, interrupting the flow of the class. He would also talk about hypothetical scenarios in algorithms that he would just love to put on his exams, which ended up being more ambiguous than Justin's, leading to a lower average in every single one of his exams. The Piazza went crazy multiple times just because of his methods and the kind of questions that he would put on his exams.
Now, from a personal perspective, this was one of the hardest CS classes that I've taken. I just felt that no matter how much I studied for each exam, there would just be this set of questions that you would just not be prepared for, which was really frustrating. You would have the same homeworks as Justin's section, which saved my grade because I did really well on those, but they barely correlate with what you need to be prepared for in the exams (Which is 83% of your grade!!!). I ended up just barely passing the class despite having solid A's and B's in all my other classes and allocating significantly more time to this class.

Things to take note of that happened with him this semester: impossible question on the makeup for exam 1s (seemed like something went wrong in their exam making process, so prob won't happen again, but still good to know), often told students to go to the other professor's lecture if they didn't enjoy his, would mostly learn most of the stuff he was teaching during class (this wasn't as bad as it was in 250), not very passionate for the material. He did make some improvements since when he taught CMSC250, but still not good. I learned more from Justin's notes than his lectures.

Lectures aren't too great for learning and is honestly more worth to study off of Justin's op notes, but I will say Max's lectures have a very inclusive feel with his quirky and funny personality. Records lectures but you need to email him for it to promote more people coming to class.

This semester, despite co-teaching Justin's class, Max decided to do his own thing. This includes straight up teaching a few different material  than Justin, even teaching one concept his own way that is required for the exam, and creating completely different exams which were noticably more difficult to study for. His first exam had a leetcode problem that was told in advance to only those attending his lectures, his second one had a large proportion of your grade in a few mc questions, and his third one was half straightforward do the algorithm types of questions while the other half were difficult conceptual questions. The third exams format was the same style as the final, which was really well written in a way that actually makes you think.

The leetcode question that other people are referring to is a question Max gave us very fair warning about (he basically told us it would be a DP leetcode easy) of which there are only a few. So if you practiced those beforehand (or even tried to figure it out on the exam), you likely would have gotten it.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Max is a really nice guy but he's a terrible professor and tries to make up for it by trying to seem like our friend. He seems really smart but can't articulate ideas properly. Multiple times, he would try to lecture on a topic, forget/not know how to explain, and then just say forget about it it's not on the exam or to refer to Justin's notes. After the first exam, I stopped going to class altogether because it was completely useless. Furthermore, his handwriting and lecture notes are terrible and therefore impossible to follow. Ultimately, you end up reading Justin's notes to teach yourself all the material. This class was supposed to be cotaught so this shouldn't be an issue. However, despite Max's inability to teach, he wants to be quirky and ask us questions that are not reflective of the material we learn all semester. Though the class is cotaught, the only similarities between Justin and Max are the homeworks, which are common between the two. The problem here is that Max makes his own exams despite using Justin's homework but doesn't give us proper practice so you can't really prepare for Max exams when you are studying. All these issues led to a massive grade discrepancy on each of the midterms between Justin and Max(totaled to about -7-8% of ur final grade if you took Max). He did not release his final averages so I can't really say too much about that but throughout the semester, it was blatant how unfair the class was and how unreceptive Max was overall. This would all be ok if Max decided to account for this discrepancy when setting grade cutoffs at the end of the semester to ""equalize"" a class that is cotaught and should be equalized regardless. However, Max being max dropped grade cutoffs by about 2% meaning that you were at about a 5-6% disadvantage if you took Max vs Justin.

Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Funny guy. Was ""co teaching"" with Justin. We had the same homework as Justin. However, instead of making the exams have a connection to the homework, like Justin's exams, Max wanted to be different the entire semester, resulting in lower exam averages, especially comparing to Justin students.",1,F,2024-05-23T01:46:56.539224Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Trying to accurately reflect on CMSC351 with Max is a challenging endeavor.  It'd be far too easy to say something like ""Max not Justin despite coteaching, therefore bad.""  I don't think it's that simple, especially since I already don't have the highest opinion of Justin for CMSC351.

First things first, lectures.  Currently, Max just doesn't pull off taking notes live during lecture like Justin does.  He often spends a lot of time during lecture just on taking notes, presumably from his own reference.  This takes away time he could be using to properly work through examples, since he is fairly unclear and/or makes mistakes on some of the examples in lecture.  I don't think Max is experienced enough with the material to pull off live note-taking without sacrificing something else about the lecture.  I think lectures would be much better if he mainly used slides for introducing material, and worked out examples live to emphasize the major takeaways.  Max certainly has the energy to be a good lecturer, but the lectures this semester weren't great.  It doesn't help Max's case that he was out for many lectures where one of the head TAs, Lana, took over, and honestly I thought she was a much better lecturer.

Next, the inconsistency with Justin.  I could whine about exams here, but I'll save that for a bit.  My main issue with inconsistency actually comes with the different notions Justin and Max used for a few of the algorithms.  Two notably come to mind: Dijkstra's and Floyd's.  In a cotaught class, even if the exams are different, I believe that the content taught across the two sections should be the same at the very least.  With Dijkstra's, Justin's notes, lectures, and psuedocode were very clear about how the algorithm should be interpreted in the context of the class, which is done to get everyone on the same page when doing Dijkstra's algorithm problems on homework and exams.  Max's students needed to know Justin's interpretation because we had Justin's homework throughout the course.  It was very clear that Justin's interpretation of the algorithm records the shortest path between the start node and every other node reachable in the graph, whereas Max's interpretation has the algorithm stop upon reaching a destination node.  I actually brought this up, which Max agreed with me, and both interpretations were made acceptable for that problem on exam 3.  Something in the same vein happened with Floyd's algorithm, where Justin's interpretation had a ""Pass By"" for each node in the graph, where Max's was something completely different.  This wasn't the worst thing in the world, because the Floyd's algorithm problem on Max's final was explicit in exactly what it wanted (shortest paths of every node to every node where the maximum number of edges on each path is 2).  However, the sentiment is the same.  Something related to this point is that Max's section did not cover shortest path algorithm, but covered bucket sort where Justin didn't... for some reason...

Alright, now it's time for exams.  Simply put, these exams were very experimental, and they did not work with Justin's grade weights of 1/6 homework, 1/6 per semester exam, and 1/3 final.  The first exam was structured very similarly to a Justin exam, except with a Leetcode easy at the end.  Oddly enough, this was the only exam I got an A on, despite the fact that I'm typically horrendous at Leetcode.  Regardless, people were vocal about despising it, so Max changed the exam structure entirely for the following exams.  Each of the following exams had a few Justin-style ""run through the algorithm"" questions, but were majorly based on more theoretical questions which I turned out to be terrible at.  Exam 2 had 30% of its score determined by 6 multiple choice questions, and some of the questions were poorly written and/or relied on knowing niche facts before you could even come close to a valid response.  Exam 3 was mostly fine, but two questions in particular emphasized memory, which isn't something we really practiced in class in any capacity.  The final was mostly fine, but a few of the questions were weighted a crazy amount, and there were a fair amount of gotchas with small, but significant point reductions throughout the exam.  I did not clutch up on the final, and I screwed up so much compared to how I wanted to do that I only qualified for an A- with a small unknown curve.  I'll take it, but at the same time I wanted to do better in this course, but I didn't know how to prepare for the exams.  I'll accept that this is a pretty big skill issue, since the exam distributions throughout the semester were honestly pretty high for both professors (Justin's were typically a few points higher on the mean, with exam 3 having an 8 percent mean disparity, but Max's averages weren't bad).  However, I also don't think this class structure was setting most people up for success, and it didn't seem that we were given much leeway while Max was figuring out what he wanted his exams to be like.  It's honestly a shame, because I can see what Max was going for with the exams.  But they simply don't work with the grade weights we were given, and after exam 1, they were mostly independent from Justin's homework which we had to do throughout the semester.

I'm conflicted.  I want to give Max a higher rating, because I genuinely believe that this class wasn't designed to hurt the students.  Max may have some amount of arrogance or whatever, but he is genuinely willing to hear you out on issues you may have, especially if you have valid points when it comes to regrades (personal experience).  However, what keeps my rating low is that this run of CMSC351 was just rough.  I feel like a lot of decisions were made just to be made, rather than for the benefit of the students.  In a sense, it was almost like taking two different algorithms classes in the same semester.  For homeworks, we had to be good at Justin-style questions, which tended to be very specific in what they were asking and the answers they wanted.  For exams, we had to be good at Max-style questions, which tended to be far more vague and/or theoretical, but the answers they expected were still very specific.  It was very tiring.",2,A-,2024-05-23T15:32:18.401211Z

I asked him to explain 3-SAT since he hinted it might be on the final and I did not understand it, and he took over 20 minutes to explain it again and again to me and the students who stopped by to listen). His exams are pretty tough and a bit of a shock at first (I bombed the first midterm and spent the rest of the semester dragging my grade back up lol), but looking back, I find that I liked how they were written. It's less repeating what you memorized and more applying what you learned, which I think is very useful.",3,B-,2024-07-01T20:49:24.453458Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"He was co-teaching with Justin. We used Justin hws and lectures. Only difference Max wrote the exams. The only problem was Max was trying to be different and made the exams something you cant really study for and not have a strong connection with the homeworks. For 351 exams make 85% of the class weight in total, with that in mind, I did really well on the Hws and Justin practice exams, but failed the class because of Maxs stupid ass.",1,F,2024-07-09T16:32:48.574935Z

Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Max knows his topics well besides some small mistakes here and there. The class would have been better if Max was more organized, he runs very disorganized day to day, and that trickles down to how he runs his courses. I also would have appreciated in-person office hours with the TAs, and I am sure some others would have appreciated this. I recommend going to practice sessions if you want a better grade in the course. His tests are decently tricky, but he curves the tests and allows those who know the topic well to get ahead. I would take him again, just plan to use either Justin's notes or another source of practice to excel in his class, and plan for somewhat long tangent discussions in class.",4,A-,2024-08-07T19:00:12.976301Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC250,"Not a bad professor. He is disorganized and tends to ramble sometimes. He does care about his students although it wouldn't hurt him to be more responsive to students who need help in time to apply it to tests. He genuinely knows the content well and uses references to real-life examples to make the class engaging. However, his exams are somewhat hard and worth almost all of the grade. However, he does boost grades significantly and is generous when it comes to rounding off grades. I would take him again, just be prepared to use another source of notes because he isn't the best with releasing timely practice.",4,A-,2024-08-07T19:16:45.637751Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC351,"Not very good at teaching. Copying most lectures from Justin is one thing but not explaining them well is worse. Added a version of bucket sort to our portions which essentially worked as counting sort to have some differentiation from Justin's course. Midterms were not hard, final was challenging but fair.
Would not recommend because it's a coin flip on whether exams will be easy or hard and whether you'll understand anything very well. The guy often pauses during his lectures and says ""I'm kind of butchering this explanation"" or something along those lines. Being self aware does not help us.",3,A,2024-08-27T12:45:42.299991Z

Maksym Morawski,DATA602,"Very knowledgable and has genuine curiosity for data science. His lectures are a little scattered brained and he could take a little more time to review the technical parts more in depth, but overall he keeps the material entertaining and relevant. His quizzes test critical thinking, not a multiple choice memorization style. Gives a lot of opportunities to make up points, but is maybe too lenient on standards. He needs to use the ELMS platform more effectively, he just throws everything into files instead of building the modules and assignment pages.",5,A,2024-10-16T22:54:11.727184Z
Maksym Morawski,DATA602,Super easy class. You can use your phone and cheat on all quizzes. Nobody cares. Easiest A and no studying required.,5,A,2024-10-23T00:35:32.653160Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"He is pretty knowledgeable but explains almost every concept very poorly (almost like he's forcing himself to use bigger words than he should). The class was very disorganized: we were told there would be about 8 projects and 2 in-class assignments (basically quizzes), but it ended up only being 5 homeworks and 1 in-class assignment—take this as you will. 
Not only are his lectures hard to understand, but he also prides himself on making EXTREMELY DIFFICULT EXAMS that are often very vague or open-ended, in all the wrong ways. He masquerades this by claiming that it's better to truly know the content deeply while making questions somehow subjective (which does the opposite btw) and by claiming that it'll be helpful in the workforce. 
The only reedamble parts of this class and the professor overall are that the homeworks were generally pretty easy and that he is a nice guy at heart. 
Overall, since he doesn't teach you how to use Python, pandas, or SQL but basically all homeworks regard these, I wouldn't recommend unless (1) you really want to take this class, (2) think you can success in spite of everything I've said, or (3) LOVE DATA SCIENCE.",2,A-,2024-12-16T04:19:37.425365Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Pretty polarizing.

This review is coming from the perspective of someone who also had Max for 351, so there will be many comparisons. But overall honestly, I think Max has the potential to get somewhat better over time, though this semester was kinda scuffed.

Max always said in class that he was more interested in data science than algorithms, but I was somewhat doubtful about whether taking 320 with Max would actually be better. Turns out it is... kind of. This class in general is much easier than CMSC351, so that's one thing for starters. There's a large buffer for your grade in 46% of assignments in the final grade. As the review below mentions, there were many more planned assignments, and they never happened: which wasn't that surprising, given that two (or really one tbh) of the assignments were extremely long.

Tests are hit or miss. Coming from 351, there are basically no ""Justin"" questions (it's almost all Max-y, but there are some questions that are much more direct and less abstract). The first test was highly curved due to poor writing, and honestly, this is something I disliked more than anything besides the abstractness (I honestly found their abstract nature fun at points). Questions are purposely vague, and likely to make you think, but it makes it really easy to misread or gauge a question's intent incorrectly.

Now, onto what I think could get better. The 1st assignment was writing... which was fairly useless, and Max realized this for next semester. The second assignment was fairly standard pandas/SQL stuff, but the 3rd assignment is where it got interesting. The 3rd assignment is honestly the best assignment in CS I've gotten ever, which I'm surprised I'm saying. It is VERY messy and very unclear, but that's partially the point, it is honestly the best way to learn stuff, and honestly reminded me of my past work/personal project experience. Probably the best assignment to actually learn, even if it was unforgiving and took forever.

I really wish the next 2 assignments had this caliber, but they were quite mundane. I know some people might think I'm crazy for suggesting that he add more assignments like HW3, but I honestly think assignments like those are probably the best way to genuinely learn about data science. 

Another problem with the homework was that ending concepts didn't really have that much focus in the last assignments, but I also realized that it would have been hard to create interesting homework based on those concepts.

Extra credit was quite scuffed this semester. Max initially made it 0.01% of the final grade, and just to put into reference how small this was: 3 notes was supposed to be 0.01%, and he changed it to be 0.05% PER NOTE. That's a 15x change, and frankly, it goes to show how little it was worth (and people thus didn't care much). Again, I do think this will hopefully get better with time.

Max's teaching style is sort of like how he was in 351, though he definitely was generally more knowledgeable about the concepts he was teaching (definitely not perfect though). It seems he didn't really care enough to make coherent slides, which led to really vague and hard-to-understand slideshows if you didn't attend the lecture. I think this is probably the most iffy point I have on Max that prevents me from giving him a higher rating because while I do think he will probably change the extra credit system/assignments, I am not sure if he will improve his teaching.

Overall though, I'd say Max is a slight upgrade from how he was in 351. As I said, comparatively to 351, this class is nowhere near as hard, though still somewhat poorly managed. Yet, there are some slight shimmers of something great, that makes the class somewhat valuable: maybe not for everyone, but definitely to some.",3,A,2024-12-18T05:06:08.403765Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"I had this guy for 351 and somehow he got a lower rating from me for 320 than that class AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. At least in 351, I walked out feeling like I knew how to apply the algorithms. It was disorganized, but it was fine. 320 however....I got a higher grade but I got majorly screwed by the final because it was essentially a midterm 3 on topics he just likes to skate over instead of actually covering in a structured method. Maybe I would have done fine if the rubric wasn't also all or nothing style with 4 points for some questions. Exams are so weird and the grades keep fluctuating because it turns out he made mistakes in the answer key/rubric. He's just a disorganized professor and honestly, do yourself a favor and don't take him. Only reason he is 2 stars is because he can be funny in class.",2,A-,2024-12-18T17:21:15.248605Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"TL;DR - If you want to go into Data Science as a career, then you should take Max. Otherwise, stay far FAR away.

Pros:
- Everything he teaches is from a practical perspective. He frames the class and his lectures in a way that would actually help someone in the future if they wanted to go into data science. This is something that a lot of CS classes fail to do in high school and college, so finding a course that directly prepares you for a career in the subject area is rare. So as someone who wants to go into Data Sci / AI / ML, this class was incredibly helpful.
- He's a fun guy
- We got an A on pretty much all of the homework assignments

Cons: 
- The exams were really tough. He makes exams so that all of the questions are open ended and require critical thinking. Because of this, it's hard to figure out what to expect on an exam. He only gave us one practice exam for each of our exams, so there just wasn't that much material to prepare with. It felt like you either knew it or you didn't.
- The class and lectures are incredibly disorganized. We had at least 3 lectures where he showed up with an unfinished slideshow. He knows all of the material that he's gonna teach, he just sometimes shows up unprepared to lectures. The class is also disorganized as well. Many assignments were posted days or weeks after they should've been.
- None of the assignments had a clear rubric. We were given very little instruction on what we should actually be doing for some of assignments. This led to a lot of late night frustration as we just didn't know what the right answer for a given problem was supposed to be. This was because of how little specification was given for the assignments.",3,A,2025-01-25T17:49:36.437191Z
Maksym Morawski,CMSC320,"Dude didn't grade any projects until the very last second, which counts for 46% of grade.

Between Dr. Walsh and Dr. Nichols, Dr. Walsh seemed a lot more professional and structured throughout the course. The class is super chill, it's an open dialogue where anybody can speak or because we had 100+ people on zoom this semester, you can get away with lurking and only listening. We watched the Get Out movie in this class and wrote two essays on it. However, the only other grades in the courses are 5 quizzes and 3 more essays which are not directly on the movie but rather, on race issues, and black history in general.

The final exam was just a powerpoint presentation where you pick any topic you want that was covered in class and make a presentation on it. You don't have to present it just do a voice recording that has to be 10 minutes long. There is also a participation grade that was basically breaking into small groups and you wrote ur name on a paper to show that you were there, but you don't know which class it'll be in so you need to go to them all.

Shane Walsh,,"I'm going to start by saying this was an incredibly easy course and it had virtually no work for it. If you are someone who is just looking for a Gen Ed this fulfills three and does not require attendance which is the only reason I gave it two redeeming stars. As for the professor he doesn't teach in class it's more of a big discussion which would be great if there was even an ounce of the structure included in anything. There is so much information in each class that you don't retain anything and he goes on a tangent every moment he gets which makes each lecture completely lose any meaning. There are only four graded assignments including two tests near the beginning of the course that are based on VERY long boring texts. You don't need to read but will need to skim until you find the answers. You also might need to scour through the modules to find a text that is loosely based on one of the questions and sort of guess from there. There is no real lecture or PowerPoint or anything to reference back to and the tests are not related to anything solid that we did in class. It also took almost the whole semester for both of those tests to be graded and by that time we moved on to our third assignment which was a short essay on the racial frame. This was fine however we never actually talked about what that meant or how to write the essay and the assignment was listed in a questionnaire response format but no real instruction on how to frame anything or any examples was given. As for the final, it's currently less than two weeks till the deadline and we have hardly spoken about it the Canvas assignment has virtually no solid information or rubric to go off of. Other people seem to have had a lot more of a structured class so maybe it was just this section as they added almost double the seats this semester so take this with a grain of salt.",2,A,2024-05-01T20:23:09.047484Z

However, as others have mentioned there is no feedback at all on any of the essays you write, and Im not sure if this is true but all of the essays the high was 94, he might not give any scores higher than that on essays. Additionally, the quizzes will have some free response questions, which are graded the same way as the essays. For example on the first quiz there was a question that asked you to introduce yourself and answer some questions, and I got points off on that question, and Im not sure why.

I will note that her grading is a bit strict, but her feedback is pretty useful. She definitely expects a lot more effort than you may want to put into a Gen Ed. My advice: if you take her for this class, make sure to talk with her about your papers.",5,A,2022-12-06T18:42:17.966349Z
Susan Pramschufer,ENGL101,"This teacher is AWESOME! She's very kind and makes the class enjoyable. It's quite a bit of essay writing, so she makes everyone work from early on and gives helpful feedback. Usually, 1 or 2 weeks before an essay/assignment is due, we would spend half the class time doing a peer review of our current progress. Basically, we get feedback WHILE we're writing the essays, rather than after we already submitted them. 
Definitely recommend her.",5,,2022-12-06T19:01:49.482394Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST204,"Professor Pramschufer is amazing! I can't recommend her enough. I was a little worried about this class since it was my first humanities class at UMD as a STEM major, but it was fairly easy. She's really enthusiastic and kind and sometimes lets you out of class early. There are two big essays and one small reflection, in class writing assignments, and two exams. Just take good notes and the essays/exams will be easy. If you go to office hours she's really helpful. Overall one of my favorite professors at UMD. Plus the class covers two gen eds so I highly recommend taking it.",5,A,2022-12-09T20:44:24.804346Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST418K,"This was my absolute favorite course I've ever taken at UMD, and much of that is thanks to Susan's obvious care for her students and the class's material. The syllabus is amazing! I was only mildly interested at first because I didn't recognize many of the movies, but by the end of the semester I've grown to appreciate each one for what it's taught me about american landscape in film. The class is structured where you watch one or two movies a week outside of class with maybe one discussion post, and then the class is a lecture format with lots of chance for class discussion. I loved this format for many reasons: I got to have movie nights with my roomies, I had time to think about the film by myself before class, and it was easy to pay attention in class because I could participate. And if participation isn't your thing, she doesn't grade it. The two essays were short, easy, and interesting. I got the feeling that she was worried about if the course was boring or not so if you do take the class and like it, make sure to tell her :) She deserves it!",5,A,2023-05-09T18:47:42.277074Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST320,"I thought this class was going to be an easy A class but I was really wrong. At the beginning of the semester, you watch several movies, focusing on different models of disability and then you do discussion posts (like 5 times). After that, no more discussion posts, which is gold to me. There are three big essays you'd have to do. An observation, scene analysis, and restatement project. Towards the ending of the semester, you'd choose a specific scene from any movie with aspects of disability in it and ""remake"" that scene to be more progressive than it is now. You do either a storyboard or a script, depending on what is your scene. Anyway, the overall course is kind of interesting, especially coming from a disabled student like me. I don't agree with some stuff that is mentioned in this course. The film class basically says that movies or we should reject patriarchal, white, straight, and male hegemony. Cultural hegemony should be rejected.  If you are a conservative, then you might not like this course??? 

But Mrs. Pramschufer is an extremely helpful teacher. She is so willing to help students understand the concepts. She would set up an appointment to meet on Zoom if you need to go over some course material. Susan really wants her students to be successful on the exams. Not sure what you understand some of the concepts? Just ask or set an appointment with her! She would try to make lots of concepts as clear as possible for students to understand. 

Also, the exams are written. No multiple choices questions.",5,B,2023-12-12T03:27:17.093662Z
Susan Pramschufer,ENGL101,"She is a great professor! She tried really hard to make the class manageable for us first-semester freshman and I really appreciated that. She was super accommodating when I got a concussion and had to miss some assignments and turn an essay in late. She really tried to connect with all of us and make sure the material we went over was interesting and relevant. Honestly, the only things I didn't enjoy were the slackers in my class and some of our zoom classes, but that's on me for taking a blended class when I knew I didn't like zoom. The couple essays we do are completely manageable because she breaks the writing process up into smaller assignments and she is super eager to give feedback before you turn it in. Even if you do fumble one of the essays, the final project is easy and great way to boost your grade. You won't regret taking her!",5,A,2023-12-20T21:44:18.171339Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST204,"Let me start off by saying Ms. Pramschufer is very sweet, and her class overall is actually pretty interesting in some ways. Now with that being said, this class is WAY too rigorous for a gen ed, with 3 essays and 2 exams. Not to mention the 11 informal writing assignments randomly assigned. On top of this, she is a strict grader and there is not much creative outlet/leniency in a class where there should be. The exams require specific answers on the short answers and essay questions, and if you don’t, you are not getting many points back. Similar grading policy on the essays, even one where I really put an all out effort to just to get a B. If you are looking for a Gen Ed, I strongly recommend not taking this class.",2,C,2023-12-25T04:29:48.737846Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST204,"I agree with some of what previous reviews are saying. Dr. Pramschufer is a very nice person, who always makes class discussions lively. In terms of content, I really enjoyed this class. The movie selection was diverse and I thoroughly enjoyed watching every film studied. 
However, the issue with this class was the amount of work and tough grading. I managed to eek by with an A- but it definitely took a lot more effort than I expected. There are multiple in class writing assignments, which are not graded very leniently. Same goes for the three major essays in the class. The exams are also graded harshly, with points awarded being nearly all or nothing. If you are looking for an easy A gen-ed, there are much better options out there.",2,A-,2024-01-20T23:24:42.167201Z
Susan Pramschufer,AMST418K,"I definitely agree that she is a tough grader. I think the thing to keep in mind is while yes this is a GenEd, it's a 400 level; course where I think the stricter grading is coming from. It's an ""easy"" course as long as you watch the movies and do the readings. That being said I did do all that but will probably end up with a B which sucks. I wouldn't say don't take her but don't take her if you're wanting a super easy A. It's Not the easiest A but it's definitely possible.",4,A-,2024-05-07T15:35:37.275717Z

While you really have to go to class, the work is super manageable and isn't too hard. If you can self motivate about your grades and take it upon yourself to ask for help and go to office hours you will get an A. No matte the assignment or due date she always made time to meet even outside of office hours and ALWAYS read my entire paper with detailed comments for editing. I really suggest you go to her office hours as she will give you comments you need to do well on the assignment.

The weekly check ins are annoying and the date/time varies sometimes which is annoying. The problem sets and papers really weigh on your grade but checkins add up too. The guest lecturers weren't as interesting as the professor herself but still somewhat interesting. Friday discussion attendance is mandatory and we were supposed to have clicker questions in lecture but never did. She tries to record the lectures if possible but they're not guaranteed.

People complain that the TAs grade too harshly but I feel that they just didn't put in as much work as they should've as they expected this to be the ""mindless gen ed"". There is a pretty big group project in the second half the semester but they give you plenty of time (like 2 months) to do it and the project itself is weighted heavily but totally manageable with enough planning. There's also a large simulation at the beginning of class that is easy points but also fun and insightful (helpful for studying for the midterm). The lectures are not mandatory but the discussions are which I thought was weird at first but made sense in the end as most of the group work is done in there.

Although it's not too challenging, it is a course that you need to spend a considerable amount of time paying attention to outside of class. There is a simulation where you have to make decisions based on your assigned role for a few weeks during the semester, one midterm, two problem sets and two written assignments which are decent parts of your grade, and then of course the final.

I personally don't recommend you take this class. If you are into this kinda stuff, the class will be fine for you. However, while the class is very, sometimes annoyingly, easy, this should not be taken as an easy gen-ed. There are two essays, a multi-week-long online simulation, two midterms (the final is optional if you are happy with your two test grades), a group project, and a weekly homework assignment. Again, while ALL are easy, it is a lot of annoying busy work; such an easy class should not have this much work. I don't find this stuff interesting so the lectures were boring.

Exams aren't too difficult; some brief studying and readiness is all it really takes to do well in this class (plus only two out of the three exams are counted towards your grade.)

Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"This course was not too difficult in general, but will require a little bit of time each week spent on it.  This IS a science course - you're not going to be getting an A+ from just spending 20 minutes per week on it.  If you come to class (mandatory anyway), actually try, and be as interested as you can, you're going to feel like you got a lot out of it.

Dr. Hayes-Gehrke is very nice and a good speaker.  She's knowledgeable and keeps everyone involved during class.

-----

The rest of this review is what to expect from ASTR220 with her teaching:

There's pre-lecture videos (anywhere from 20-45 minutes generally) followed by a quick multiple choice quiz.  TAKE NOTES WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEOS!!  You will be hating life later if you don't because you'll have no notes to study from for the exams.  I had groupmates that took zero notes and were complaining about having to watch the videos again to study for the exam.  These are your homework (alongside projects).  No textbook.

The pre-lecture videos prevent you from being lectured during class.  Instead, you're going to be doing rapid fire multiple choice questions, class discussions on the topics, and a calculation here and there with your groups.  She does this to prevent the typical ""lecture until you're bored"" style of class, and it works in my opinion.

Speaking of groupmates...you will have them for the entire semester.  You're going to be assigned them in the beginning of the semester - some you will be ok with, some you will dislike.  Learn to get along and distribute work instead of complaining, and your life will be a lot easier.  Use Google Docs to get your work done, add comments to papers, etc. to make your life so much easier.  Set deadlines, and start early!  If you follow those guidelines, you'll never receive less than an A on the projects.  And if anyone isn't pulling their weight, you get to grade your teammates based on work effort after the project is submitted.

You'll have multiple projects:  
1)  a research paper about a specific asteroid
2)  a poster (large powerpoint slide) project on a random astronomy topic/event, which you'll have printed and present to multiple people/groups
3)  a paper where you design a spacecraft to accomplish a specific goal/mission
4)  a debate (group vs group) about a random topic that you'll do in front of the class
These projects span across weeks, giving you tons of time to take your time on them and not make you feel overwhelmed.  I do feel that projects were graded a little harshly though.  They weren't unfair, but it just seemed that we lost a few points here or there for minor things, which was making it impossible to get the A instead of A- or B+.  

The grading also seemed to get MUCH harsher as the semester went on.  I felt that she was being overly picky on many aspects of grading projects and exams towards the end of the semester, especially given how busy you are juggling all of your classes.

Two midterms, which are average difficulty (35 multiple choice questions that are exactly like the in-class multiple choice questions she posts on the slides) and 6 or so short answer questions (sometimes involving a quick calculation or explanation).  Equations are provided, you'll just be expected to understand concepts like ""If this asteroid has properties A, B, and C, and I do ""this"" to it, what will happen?""  You get re-tests though:  You take the exam, and then you get another week or so to take the exact exam at home with all of your resources, classmates, etc. and bring it back in.  Your score will be the average of the two scores, and any additional points that you got from your average compared to your original score will be added as bonus points to your final exam score (since there's no re-test for the final).  i.e. if you got a 90, then re-test you got a 100, your average score is 95.  So 5 points are added to your final exam score.  Final exam was all essay/short answer questions.  Felt easy after finishing, but the grade was A LOT lower than I expected, again due to extremely nit-picky grading.

Discussion section is fine.  We had to get an assignment done each time (pretty easy) and just go over with our groupmates what we're doing/any progress on projects and such.  It's what you would expect.

Excluding studying for exams, you'll likely spend about 2-4 hours per week on this class (1-2 hours on pre-lecture stuff and another 1-2 hours on projects, depending on how hard you're working).  Overall, most people learned a ton from this course and want to take ASTR315 with her next semester (and are considering Astronomy minors).  ",5,A,2014-12-18T19:09:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR310,"If you focus on lectures alone, Hayes-Gehrke is a fantastic professor. She's clear,  patient with students, and open to student concerns and questions.

With that said, the workload for the number of credits that the course is worth is absolutely atrocious. In terms of what I'd consider to be assignments done out of class, there were ""Pre-Lecture Quizzes"" for nearly every lecture, ""Homework"" assignments for which there were 5, and ""Projects"" for which there were 3. 

The ""Pre-Lecture Quizzes"" are exactly as they sound like and take about 30 minutes each to complete. ""HW"" assignments could very easily be called projects in any other classes as they were fairly difficult and took a significant amount of time (upwards of 4 hours each). The 3 ""Projects"" we were assigned were even worse in terms of difficulty and time required for completion, and the last of the projects could well be considered 2 projects with a single due date. Any one of these 4 assignments would constitute a ""Final Project"" in another class.

Another caveat of the class is group work. You have to make resumes to post online to your classmates, against your classmates so that you can hurry and make fairly permanent groups in 10 minute scramble. This group is probably going to be with you for the rest of the semester working on each project. This can be both a good and a bad thing, as it's encouraged that you work with classmates on the HW assignments. Having a group you're comfortable with can make the HW process easier, but you're also stuck with them for 4 months. 

I've definitely learned a significant amount in this course, but not nearly as much as the work requirement should indicate. I would take the course again, but only if I were warned ahead of time of how much of a time Hayes-Gehrke demands.",4,B,2014-12-17T16:25:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"I've taken three courses with this professor. When I was a freshman in ASTR100, I hated her. I felt like she babied her students and was condescending.

After taking two more classes with her (ASTR220 and ASTR300), she became my favorite teacher. She's written me multiple recommendations, and has been very helpful to me. She was always willing to listen to questions about grading, and after getting over myself I realized that her methods, while slightly babying, are amazingly helpful for learning the material.

You'll never find a professor more committed to helping every single student do well. If you are willing to actually do the homework (rarely more than half an hour) and do some group projects, you'll come out of it with a lot more knowledge and a professor who will write you great recommendations.

I fully recommend all three of the courses I have taken with her.",5,A+,2014-12-03T07:25:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"Let me start by saying that I am NOT one to write reviews but after taking this course im sorry to say that professor gherke made me feel the need to warn people about her class.im not kidding when I say that this professor does not lecture. She forces you to watch pre-lecture videos of her talking before coming to class (most upwards of 25-30 minutes) which you then take a quiz on. This is horrible for learning as much as she thinks otherwise. I know she doesn’t believe in “traditional teaching styles” but her version of teaching is terrible (because she DOESN’T teach). Imagine teaching yourself and then coming to class and being quizzed everyday --- this is astr100 in a nutshell. Mind you, the grading in this course is insanely harsh.  I am a physics major taking this course for a minor and I was completely floored by the grades I was receiving in this class. She asks incredibly specific questions that ask you to apply what you know (often times trying to trick you) and will not hesitate to give you a 0/5 for a less than perfect answer. Her questions are sometimes so watered down and baby-ish that you will actually get them wrong just by second-guessing yourself. I loved astronomy before this but this professor has been incredibly frustrating. No matter how hard you study, she will never actually test you on anything but repetitive equations and hypothetical scenarios which you’ve never talked about. This class needs to SERIOUSLY be changed. Please save yourself the headache and do not take any course with this professor. Your gpa will thank you i absolutely promise.",1,,2014-04-23T15:41:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"After a few semesters, I've realized that professor Hayes-Gehrke is the best professor I think I've had here at UMD. She really, really wants you to learn the material, and teaches it to you how she thinks is best. If you do all the work she assigns (which really isn't that time consuming), I guarantee you will get an A in this class. She teaches you the information that you need to know before lecture in a pre-lecture video and then teaches you the same material with examples in lecture. This really drills the information into your brain. It was because of her teaching style that I got an A+ in the class and over 100 on the final exam, and frankly, I wish more teachers would teach like Hayes-Gehrke does.",5,A+,2014-03-12T20:59:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"Professor Hayes-Ghehrke is a pretty solid professor.  She taught the class very clearly, and almost always had an interesting picture or story related to the topic at the beginning of every class.
She does have her students do a little ""topic briefing"" and attendance slip that they have to pick up at the beginning of class and turn in on the way out, which means you have to attend most of her lectures unless you find a way to slip your attendance paper into the box at the beginning and leave.  Her classes are very interesting though, so I recommend just going to them.

The biggest downfall to this class is probably the group work.  There is a lot of it.  You usually end up doing a little group worksheet in most discussions, and there is a large ""poster project"" at the end of the semester that you must do in a group of around four.  As someone who despises group work, this aspect of the class sucked, but overall, it's a very fascinating class that you learn a lot of interesting things in, and Hayes-Gehrke herself is a very clear and easy to listen to professor.",4,A,2013-12-10T22:34:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"I think Hayes-Gehrke is a really cool professor. Like others have said, she talks to you like your a kid and babys you through every single activity, but that only slightly takes away from her overall success as a lecturer. She really knows her stuff. 

The work, however is a different story. Before every single lecture, she posts mandatory ""prelecture"" videos that are often more than 30mins long. This can be super annoying. However, I find that I can skip through the videos in 5-10mins and still get a 100 on the quizzes. 

She is really a stickler on grading group projects. She takes points off in random places and I often found myself getting Bs when i thought i deserved at least an A-.

The one redeeming quality to the coursework is the exams. They are a complete joke. The way she works it is that you go to the exam and take it, and when youre done you pick up a second copy of the exam which you take home and complete with youre notes. You hand in the second copy and she averages the two grades together! You really have to be an idiot to get less than a B on the exams because what ever grade you get is averaged with a 100 (which I got on both midterm ReTests). 

Overall, the class can be kind of annoying sometimes, but I think the material is interesting and it really doesnt take that much effort to get a good grade. I would recommend taking it. ",5,A,2012-11-29T15:42:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"Makes what should be a very easy class, very difficult. The workload was fairly large for a 100-level class. Also, a lot of the work that you submit for this class will be graded very harshly. Take another teacher.",2,B,2012-05-21T02:20:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"I'm not really positive how I feel about Hayes-Gehrke and this class. I went back and forth between really liking her as a professor and really disliking her as a professor. I think by the end of the class, I settled into liking her quite a bit.

The class had a ton of group work, which became insanely frustrating at times. She did make a pretty solid effort to match the teams well, and my team was decent. Still, the class definitely could have done without a project or two, since I often felt like I was doing more work in this class than in some of my 400-level computer science courses. The exams were very easy, but they were not worth very much.

She kind of taught like she was speaking to a bunch of five year-olds. At the beginning of the course I thought it was a huge relief, since I'm sick of being held to a stupidly high standard in so many of my courses. After a while it became kind of annoying, and then frustrating since there was a stark contrast between how she spoke and what she expected of us in some projects, like the research poster. By the end of the course I began to appreciate it again. I don't think she does it to be demeaning, I think she is just a very kind and caring person to the point of sometimes sounding like a kindergarten teacher.

In the end I did well and learned a ton. I was surprised at how much I could learn while feeling like I was in a kindergarten classroom. I went from completely space-ignorant to being able to hold a serious conversation about pretty much anything related to our space program, especially if it concerned a threat of impact. I also feel like this class was among one of the most practical I took at the university, even though I only really took it because it had a badass name and I needed a core science. I feel like I'm highly informed if I ever have the chance to vote about space issues or make a case to anybody else. Overall, a valuable course, just gets super annoying at times.",4,A,2012-01-11T03:33:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"This class was lot of fun. She had completely new style of teaching. So many activities in the classroom (no problem if you are shy); even planetarium like displays. But there is lot of work to do. You have to watch a pre lecture video before every lecture and do a quiz on that. Then you also have to write a post lecture summary every time. They seemed hard in the beginning but then you get use to it. One can get a in this class, if you devote that time here. Also, I would like to mention I learned so many new things from this course. Its completely wonderful and the only class in the week which I look forward to. TAs are one the best (extremely helpful) and professor is very sweet. There are 3 midterms and a final. There is a ""retest"" paper in all three midterms where you boost your score by doing the same exam you did the classroom now at home. She usually gives 3-4 days for that, and encourages discussing with fellow students. All exams are half multiple choice and half essay types. Scoring policies are extremely fair. Recommended!",4,A,2012-01-09T00:52:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"Professor Hayes-Gehrke is an interesting professor and definitely one-of-a-kind.

Basically, here are the main points about her that really (in my opinion) define her teaching style:

1) She is VERY patient with students' questions which leads me to believe that she has done a lot of research about teaching styles. Honestly, this can get pretty annoying if you have a head on your shoulders as there were a couple of people in my class who would literally ask her a question that she had just explained thoroughly and she would jump right in without a thought (and waste time).

2) As implicitly stated above, she likes to baby her students. She takes attendance, has mandatory rough draft editing for papers and never, ever refrains from answering a terrible question.

3) This might sound harsh, but she's a fairly poor quiz/exam writer. She has a tendency to say something in class and then put an oddly worded question on an online quiz that correlates to what she said but has a slightly different answer than what you'd expect based on her wording. Her exam questions are also pretty tricky.

4) This is the most important point of all: She somehow manages to make the class very interesting from start to finish. I think it's her delivery style but I had little trouble in following her throughout the entire lecture (unless I was exhausted). She definitely made this course a fun experience for me.

Based on all of the above I recommend taking ASTR220 with Dr. Hayes-Gehrke. She's got her quirks but the class is pretty interesting and the exams and quizzes are easy enough where getting an A in the class isn't too much trouble. Oh, one more thing, if you like group projects than take this class -- We had to do ~5 (and they were graded fairly easily).",4,A-,2011-12-20T15:04:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"She's definitely excited about the material, I'll giver her that. The way this class is currently structured is also really nice. I took this class once before, and it has really been streamlined since then. The textbook has been scrapped, and has been replaced by online ""pre-lecture summaries"" and ""pre-lecture quizzes"". All you gotta do is watch the pre-lecture summary and then take the 8-point or so multiple choice quiz. Sounds easy enough, but it can get aggravating when the pre-lectures are easily as long as the in-class lectures themselves. Plus you gotta do the darn things three times a week. On top of that, each in-class lecture is followed by an online ""post-lecture summary"" that is related to the lecture material, but oftentimes requires you to think outside the box more.

The exams are also easy (I can't say much about the final, I haven't taken that yet). The attendance policy is forgiving and the lectures are by no means boring. You can tell Ms. Hayes - Gerhke is really trying to find the ""perfect formula"" for getting students to remember information. 

One thing I wish she would stop doing is treating the class like little kids. She has a habit of stating something that is blatantly wrong, then asking ""do you agree? Or... is that not the case?"" or something to that effect. Then she waits for people to say WHY her statement is incorrect, and all the while people just sit there going ""durr... do we really have to spell it out for you? Again?"". It might just be another weapon in her arsenal of learning techniques (specifically, the weapon of mindless repetition), and if it is, I don't like it. The flash cards she uses are also kind of lame. The colors of the cards are generic and not at all what I'd expect from a college-level astronomy class.

Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"She is a great person, nice, and never judges students or makes them feel bad. But she does baby the students around, I felt like I was in middle school. I thought this class would be a breeze because of her teaching style but I was wrong. She screwed us all over with the midterms. Yes, there is a curve, and I thought I would be fine, but I ended up getting a B and so did everyone else. She is nice but she is an unfair grader and has a TA that is the most clueless and dumb TAI have ever seen in my life. ",3,B,2011-08-20T14:33:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"She was an okay teacher. She dumbed it down which is good if you are not a science person. On the exams, particularly the exam 3, she totally screwed us over. She made all the essays tricky and worded them badly. Basically in discussion the entire class was talking about how terrible she worded the questions to purposefully mess us up. She's a nice person and lectures aren't too bad. 

IF you wanna take this class..just remember to STUDY YOUR BUTT off for midterm 3. For a core class it could be a lot worse. Overall, I personally I am not extremely fond of her but for science she's not too bad. Just expect a lot of work. ",2,B,2011-05-04T23:54:00Z

This class is NOT easy though. It is not an easy A at all and does require a lot of work. There is a post-lecture quiz after every lecture, 2 tests, 1 final, 1 research paper, 1 project, 1 team debate, discussion and attendance. I suggest having taken Astr100 because you do jump right into Astronomy. I recommend the teacher, not the class if you're looking to satisfy an easy CORE class.",4,B,2010-12-21T00:56:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"Interesting class, easy A, lots of work. You might be turned off by her ridiculous demanding of extremely large amount of time for a simple 100 level class, but you get to learn a LOT. You'll be tempted to skip lectures, but she takes attendance. For both lectures and discussion. 

My TA on the other hand was useless, condescending, and self-absorbed. She would make herself sound smart by saying terms that we don't even need to know for the exams. Things that she's learned in her ""upper"" level Astr class. I mean, really though? I didn't enjoy the discussion portion mainly because of her.

Overall, this class made me decide to minor in Astronomy. If you think it's interesting, or just need a PS core, then I would definitely recommend you taking it with Dr. H",3,A,2010-12-10T12:46:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR100,"I am not a science person at all, but the professor made the course material pretty interesting with examples and demonstrations of concepts in class. Some of the material can be difficult, but if you do all the work and study at least a little, you'll do fine. 
Exams can be graded pretty unfairly on the short answer sections, because sometimes it seems like A LOT more points are taken off than should be for whatever little mistake was made. BUT after every midterm, you can choose to do an easy ""mid-term analysis"", explaining why you got each wrong answer wrong (which you can discuss with your TA) and that will give you an automatic 10% added back onto your midterm.
She takes attendance every class with a slip you have to personally hand to a TA, and attendance is a good portion of your grade. There is also a pretty time consuming ""pre-lecture video"" (usually about 30 min) accompanied by a ""pre-lecture quiz"" before EVERY lecture, and a ""post-lecture summary"" after EVERY lecture. If you do the quizzes and go to lecture, you never have to read. It's not hard work, but this class does take A LOT of time. ",3,A,2010-12-01T00:30:00Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR220,"She is a fantastic professor. I am always amazing how enthusiastically she will answer people's stupid questions or questions that she had answered like 2 seconds before.  She is very nice and engaging. 

The class is extremely easy but also really awesome. I mean it's a class on saving the Earth from an asteroid collision, what could be more interesting.  There is a online quiz after every lecture that you can do anytime and questions are right from the lecture which are on elms and you can use. I have not gotten lower than a 100 on one and they take maybe 5 minutes. No homework or in class quizzes. 

There are three projects, a 4 page research paper and 8 minute presentation on an interesting topic. A mission to build a spacecraft to study an asteroid with a budget. And finally an in class debate. All these projects are done with a group that was picked for you at the beginning of the year. Have not really met with my group once except to watch Deep Impact, and still get good grades. 

There are three exams, two midterms and a final. All very easy, with the ability to get ten points extra on the exam if you do corrections.

Also, the tests are only worth 45% of the grade, the rest is a random mix of homeworks, quizzes, and lecture and discussion attendance. I did not like the fact that only 50% of the points on the tests were multiple choice. Those were easy. The rest were short answer Qs that were graded harshly. I got 3 out of 10 points taken off my answer to one question because I forgot to include the words ""low density.""

I enjoyed the asynchronous nature of the course but the way the professor decided to restructure the course was WAY overcomplicated. There were no grades, just ""badges"" that you get after completing assignments. It was nearly impossible to remember what amount of badges correspond to what grade. There's more about this but it's going to be irrelevant soon anyway. This is my only reason for 4/5 stars.

There are no formal exams, but the challenge questions and projects provide an opportunity to engage with and learn the content of the course in a much more dynamic and experiential way. Also a reasonably understanding and nice person.",5,A,2024-12-14T02:20:39.481506Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR310,"Great person and lecturer overall. The class is very focused on LEARNING vs. memorization which is key to making the class enjoyable. The content is not too difficult. Heavy emphasis on in-class group discussion (groups of 4) + two partnered projects that go on simultaneously in the semester. In the end, you present the other 2 peoples project while they present yours. Only one real exam, the final. ""Challenges"" are used instead which are more application based/real-world examples of the content you learn vs. a typical exam. Labs are also primarily working on your projects, so after the first 5 weeks, the labs are basically ONLY attendance.",5,B,2024-12-19T01:05:00.233267Z
Melissa Hayes-Gehrke,ASTR315,Dr HG is amazing! I wouldn't be surprised if she was an education double major because she's so good at structuring her class towards all types of students. She really makes it impossible to be bored during class and she focuses on applications of the material as well as learning instead of memorizing.,5,A,2025-03-01T06:36:42.928224Z
Leslie Pick,BSCI410,"She is really nice. probably one of the best professors I have ever had. I got a B in the class though, because her multiple choice questions were tough. However, she truly care about her student and curves at the end. ",4,,2015-12-19T20:02:00Z
Leslie Pick,BSCI410,"I second the review below; Dr. Pick is a fantastic professor who actually cares about her students understanding the material. This class is definitely a step above BSCI222 and the homeworks can be challenging. Whatever you do, make sure you go to office hours, she is very helpful there. The difficulty of the exams is what you would expect and the exams are fair (not to mention you get to drop your lowest midterm). Also, her tests are heavily problem-based so make sure that you do ALL of the practice problems she assigns. The only real downside is that she goes really fast in lecture (~60-70 slides in 75 minutes) so not only is there a lot of material, but it is also difficult to keep up with it. If you have to choose between Dr. Pick and Dr. Mount, from what I've heard, you have to be foolish to choose Mount. ",5,A,2015-05-20T13:52:00Z
Leslie Pick,BSCI410,Dr. Pick is an amazing professor. In the upper level bios its pretty hard to find a professor who actually wants their students to learn and doesn't just go through the motions in order to do research. This is pretty difficult genetics but she really tries her best to help you to understand. She gives you 3 homeworks and 2 midterms but only your higher grade midterm counts so the class isn't based purely off of exams. She also really considers peoples answers other than the ones she originally thought of in the answer key. If what you say makes sense she will mark you right. Honestly though her lectures are purely based on her slides so going to class isn't quite as mandatory as others. She's also a really nice person so stopping by for office hours is recommended if you don't understand something because she'll really try to help you to understand. ,5,A,2011-05-19T13:03:00Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"She goes very fast during lectures, covering 50 slides in one lecture. However, the TAs make this class much more manageable in terms of help on homework and before exams. The grading is mitigated by the fcat that one Graded HW and one Exam are dropped by the end of class.  ",4,A,2020-06-08T00:57:44Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"I had Dr. Pick online for Genetics and I enjoyed her passion throughout the course.  I liked how she gave examples from her own research and research from UMD that directly tied to the concepts she taught.  Her lectures sometimes were a bit roundabout - there probably were more simpler ways to say some of the things she wanted to say but she was extremely helpful during office hours.  She gives plenty of practice problems, homework, and lecture quizzes that boost your grade and help you prepare for the exams.  ",5,A,2021-05-13T21:41:37Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Good professor in the sense that she does really want her students to succeed. Was not a fan of the flipped classroom format though, and I felt that some of the exams were unfair (pulled specific material from previous units). Her exams are very specific, so you do really need to know the material well and I recommend studying at least a week in advance. Very sweet professor though and will do her best to help if you reach out. Also drops a lot of assignments which was a plus, and exams are not worth a huge part of your grade (~50%).",4,A,2022-05-23T18:51:35Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Dr. Pick was very nice and generous with gaining extra credit/points to boost your grade. Her classroom is flipped, where we watch lectures outside of class and then attend class to do practice problems or learn about something loosely related to genetics. I was not the hugest fan because it did take a lot of time out of my schedule, and I would've preferred if she taught in person rather than through a video. Her exams were super fair, and again, there is a lot of buffer room that you can accumulate through discussion wksts, hws, etc. Overall, an enjoyable class!",4,A,2023-05-13T21:18:13.071353Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Honestly, the concepts taught in this class were not too bad. It's just the amount of work outside of class that makes it burdensome. There are 2 lectures (about 1 hour each) per week with quizzes (which were easy) that took a majority of my time. Tuesdays were for practice problems (optional), but Thursdays were used for guest lectures and concept applications, which made going to class kind of useless if you did not watch the lectures ahead of time. The structure of this class is something everyone complained about, so you will just have to get used to it. Dr. Pick is a nice person, but the class was just a lot of work. The TAs were the best though. There are 3 midterms (1 dropped), plenty of discussion assignments, quizzes, 3 Homeworks (1 dropped), other grade cushioning assignments, and the final. I would not worry about this class because there so much grade buffer and extra credit opportunities.",3,A+,2023-05-13T22:43:21.989085Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Genuinely sweet professor - she brought candy to our final for a sugar boost! Not a terrific professor, in the sense that she basically reads off slides when she lectures. The classroom format is flipped where we have to watch prerecorded lectures outside of class, and then during class, we do practice problems or have a guest speaker. There is a LOT of buffer points you can earn, from homeworks, discussion wksts, extra credit, and she also drops one exam from our 3 midterms. Not the best class I've ever taken, but it wasn't a bad experience at all.",5,A,2023-05-19T02:11:29.029872Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Really didn't like the flipped classroom format, there was just so much content and the videos were very long and heavy. I'd say the exams were pretty fair, the free response can be a little tricky. The good thing is the discussions, lecture quizzes, and homeworks are all grade boosters so you don't need to worry too much as long as you put in effort and study. Dr. Pick is nice, and the TAs were great, for me, genetics itself is difficult to make engaging which isn't Dr. Pick's fault. Overall, it is sometimes a pain to get through but nothing too difficult or unmanageable.",3,A,2023-05-22T02:50:50.990047Z

Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Fair professor, only gave her a four star because some of her exams had very specific material that you need to know. Lectures were online, but Thursdays were practice problems in class and therefore were ""mandatory."" Tuesdays were optional. Toward the end of the year, she gave 10 points of in class extra credit. If you weren't there, you didn't get the extra credit. Discussion was easy and the TAs are the best. 3 midterms, drops one. Final wasn't cumulative. 3 Homeworks, drops one. Two weekly quizzes, totaling 25 and drops 9. 20 discussions, drops one.",4,A-,2023-05-27T01:36:35.530408Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"as a person, pick is nice and understanding. however as a professor, i didn't like her style of teaching. this course was a flipped classroom, so we had to watch videos on our own time. this was annoying because for many of the videos she would read directly off the slide and not offer additional information. during in-person class, she would just focus on practice problems and rarely review the lecture material.",3,A,2023-06-25T18:35:35.711357Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"Dr. Pick seems like a very nice lady, but the structure of this class is terrible. You basically never need to go in person, only watch the videos and you will do well. However, the videos are so boring and long. I think the textbook explains many of the concepts better than she does. Despite doing well in the class, I don't feel like I learned much.",3,A+,2023-08-02T18:23:39.218645Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"I really enjoyed Genetics with Dr Pick.  She changed the course structure this semester to be a more standard structure (3x 50min classes per week).  Usually 2 classes per week were lectures and the other one was an application or problem review.  I made a point to go to (almost) all lectures but I didn't go to the problem reviews because I figured them out on my own usually.  At first it annoyed me that lecture slides were DENSE (50-60 slides in 50 minutes) but they were super helpful when studying.  I didn't buy the textbook and I felt like lecture slides gave me more than enough information.  
 
Grading- it seemed fair.  25% points are free from discussion (the TAs are chill).  Exams make up 41% (3 midterms, 12% each, one is dropped, and final which was 17%).  HW makes up 18% (4 and one is dropped).  The rest is easy quizzes, questions are MC and straight from lecture.  Some extra credit too.  HW is time consuming and exams are challenging.  But the biggest thing is that none of the content is impossible.  I enjoyed learning some of the challenging content and found it interesting.  Truly my first class at UMD where I really noticed at the end that i had learned a lot.  
 
I'll end by saying that I seriously considered dropping ILS after the sh*t pile that was HLSC280 in the fall, but I am so glad I stayed and took 322.  I wish Dr Pick taught more undergrad classes because I would absolutely take her again.  She was receptive to questions in lecture and provided thoughtful answers.  Definitely recommend and I hope she continues to teach HLSC322 because she is a good fit for the content and the students.",5,A,2024-05-18T03:19:58.212632Z
Leslie Pick,HLSC322,"The structure of the class was changed a lot this year – no more flipped classroom and 3 lectures a week instead of 2. Dr. Pick is super sweet and helpful, and although she goes quite fast, she takes time to answer any questions you have. She’s very nice with grading – tons of extra credit opportunities and she drops your lowest midterm and homework – and the final isn’t cumulative. TAs are very helpful as well.

The grading can be annoying, inconsistent, and stingy and the class is just Dr. Pick reading form the slides but there is a lot of extra credit, if you give this class a quarter effort you'll come out with an A like 70% of students. Also make the most of it; it's a small class with 50 kids instead of 200, problems on the board, you can ask questions, and Dr. Pick is really nice and will always answer (also TAs will give HW & Discussion answers if you go to office hours).",4,A+,2024-05-26T08:09:38.320321Z

We got lots of drops for papers, he gave lots of opportunities for extra credit, and made the lab not too difficult.

However, he does drop your lowest grade for each type of assignment, gives extensions, and does exam reviews. If you need help, he will help.

Jacob Coutts,PSYC300,"Dr. Coutts is really cool. He is genuinely a really funny and passionate guy. His workload can be heavy at times and he doesn't post his slides consistently, which is frustrating, but as long as you keep up with the gist of things you will do well. His exams are HARD but they are open note and online. Take good notes, you can literally copy from the slides, and you will do well on these exams. Oh also he comes to class around 10 minutes late every time.
The other major graded assignments are APA papers, a presentation, and a poster at the end of the semester. For these assignments you submit both a draft and a final copy. This is great because you basically have two shots at each assignment. Being thorough on your draft is the best way to succeed on these. Pre- and post-labs are easy but can sometimes time consuming so don't procrastinate those. He does grade drops for the writing assignments and others, which really helps your grade.
I have learned that I HATE RStudio, but I don't think thats a shocker. Don't miss lab, thats how you'll be able to do the coding assignments as your TA should guide you through everything. Also, there is a textbook that is accessible that has walkthroughs on most of the relevant topics.
Lastly - this is not on Coutts, but if you have a bad TA, it sucks. My GTA always lagged on grading our writing assignments, consistently came to lab in a bad mood (which affected the content), and was honestly kind of mean at times :/
Overall, Dr. Coutts is a good professor and I would take a class with him again!",5,A,2024-12-05T17:11:11.657548Z
Jacob Coutts,PSYC300,"The 5-star is only because Dr. Coutts was incredibly kind and tried his best to make the class less stressful, but the class itself was the bane of my existence. Dr. Coutts tries his best to make his lectures interesting and his slides are usually informative enough that you can teach it to yourself if you don't show up to class. He does not record his lectures and your participation grade is partially dependent on attendance, so you will have to show up at least sometimes (he might be changing this next semester though, so idk). He also tries to lessen your workload as much as possible by dropping your lowest grade on your papers, giving you rough drafts (graded leniently for feedback) before final drafts are due, providing several easy extra credit opportunities, and making exams online + open note. He certainly tries to lessen the workload, but it's still a lot. Labs are every week for 2 hours and there are pre-lab and post-labs you have to do. Once you start writing papers, you basically have to write one every week until the end of the semester, and it doesn't help that almost none of the TAs graded them on time. I wasted more time on this class than organic chem. The workload is just really heavy and tedious, but the information is never super difficult. I've heard Dr. Coutts is the easiest compared to all the PSYC300 professors, but you're still going to be doing a ton of work regardless of who you take.",5,A,2024-12-11T20:01:40.334290Z
Jacob Coutts,BSOS233,"Dr. J is a great instructor with a kind of dry humor that really makes the class enjoyable. He genuinely cares about his students' learning and values feedback, which is something I really appreciate. He offers generous dropped assignments and fair grading, which helps alleviate some of the pressure. His in-lecture teaching is honestly much more effective than the textbook. He explains concepts very clearly, and while the slides are posted online, they are much more useful when accompanied by his lectures, especially since some classes are heavy on live coding.

One thing I truly respect is that after the election, Dr. J made class virtual and recorded it. He also made lab virtual (which isn’t required to attend in-person). This shows that he understands the stress students are under and cares about their mental health. The content itself wasn't too challenging, but I highly recommend reading the assigned text (which is free and online). In terms of workload, the ""Assignments"" can take a long time due to their many components. I would recommend looking ahead to see how they align with the lab content, as one assignment might cover material from multiple labs. Doing the labs in-person is more time-efficient than doing them on your own, as the TA walks you through each step.

The ""reading quizzes"" are low-stakes and easy, and you get two tries, which is great. The midterm, however, was a bit tricky. It was online and all multiple choice, but I felt underprepared because the study guide was somewhat sparse. The final project was very time-consuming, involving a lot of coding and analysis, but as with the assignments, reviewing the labs can help, as you can use the code/concepts directly for the project. Overall, Dr. J’s class was a positive experience, and his teaching style really supports student success.",5,A,2024-12-17T14:24:54.540204Z
Jacob Coutts,BSOS233,"Dr. Coutts is a nice guy but he tended to come late to class. However, the class structure was very organized, which I appreciated. Each week there was a mini quiz that you got 2 attempts on. There was also a lab due each week, but we went over the answers in lab, so I recommend showing up. There was one midterm, a final project, and a couple of other assignments throughout the semester.

The lectures were a little monotonous and not super related to the labs. This class might be a little confusing if it's your first exposure to programming, but if you pay attention to the lectures and especially the LABS, you'll be fine. He also drops your lowest grade for the quizzes, labs, and assignments. Workload wasn't too bad.",4,A,2024-12-18T03:43:43.456582Z

Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"Honestly, I don't even know where to start.  The professor didn't seem to fully grasp the concepts he was teaching, and the ""correct"" answers on his quizzes were frequently vague or blatantly wrong.  I remember one question asking ""Which of these is an expensive way to ship?"" Answers: Freight, flight, boat.  The 
 answer was boat but wtf okay I guess.
Oh yeah, and he recycles most of his quiz and exam questions from previous semesters.  It's a classic situation of an easy class conceptually with lengthy and confusing multiple choice questions that make up 100% of the grade.",2,B,2019-10-28T18:25:08Z
Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"The previous review is a bit harsh but it is a situation where it is an easy class with lots and lots of concepts/topics that only have quizzes and exams as your grade. The topics/concepts are honestly very very basic and easy, the problem is that the professor goes on forever about them. His philosophy is that he drills the concepts in your head till you honestly do not need to study that hard to do well on the quizzes. But the problem is that he repeats things constantly and it is very hard to stay motivated and pay attention to class. His quizzes are also recycled and are mostly on Quizlet so you can study for those before going to class as prep. Though, some questions are a bit tricky and do not genuinely test the students' understanding (strange wording and some ""kinda right"" answers to trick you). 

He claims that you can earn the grade you want in the class by signing up for presentations (15 min ones you present to the class) but he is kind of slow on answering emails and queues you weirdly with the other students who are desperately trying to up their grades. I also feel like he favors some supply chain major students more which can be unfair if you are trying to sign up presentations and you can get bumped down.

I really do not see the reason to go to class if you do read the textbook on your own time, the chapters are kind of long but the classes you go to is him basically reading textbook slides (he does not share his slides) and him verbally drilling things into you. He is a great lecturer but after sitting through it for almost an entire semester of him projecting loudly, it gets very tiring and boring. He has a no laptop policy (except when we have quizzes) and wants you to do handwritten notes (unless you have accommodations) which is his attempt in keeping your attention. I would be more ok with the class if I can type my notes and do other work because it is honestly a waste of time to sit through class. I am glad I read the textbook on my own time since he zooms through concepts or goes through the same concept for 20 minutes. 

I would not recommend taking him but if you need a relatively chill class and ok doing work outside of class, this class is good. I am not a supply chain major but he is good at explaining and breaking things down for you and the topic is relatively interesting if you want a taste. ",3,B-,2022-04-25T15:57:45Z
Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"I really enjoyed this class, as stressful as it was. Professor Coronado is funny, engaging, and knows supply chain management inside and out. My best advice is read the chapters slowly and carefully, and utilize quizlet for all the terminology (there are already quizlets made for this specific class). Another thing: watch out for the quizzes. Each point counts, so make sure you know what material will be covered and make sure you know it well. 
The class becomes super engaging after the first couple weeks; conversations about current supply chain developments and course material were interesting and useful. Professor Coronado is a great, really friendly guy who cares about his students—he constantly reminded us that he is willing to help out with any questions, whether it is about class/connections/careers/etc. 
Some of his quiz questions could sway to one answer or another, but he encourages you to email him and argue for your answer choice to try to get your points back.
Also, book the extra credit presentations early. Spots will fill up quickly, and I'd recommend presenting at least once in each half of the semester so that you have some level of comfort going into the exams.",4,A,2022-07-14T20:02:06Z
Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"This is a great class content-wise, it's useful for pretty much all majors and it's not super difficult to understand concepts. Exam questions are very different from quiz questions and the exams are difficult to understand. The wording of exam questions is pretty confusing. He does extra credit in the form of optional class presentations. Not all sections are at the same pace so you should try to go to your section only. If you miss class, it is difficult to catch back up. The textbook is hardly used and very lengthy. Everything we learn is in his presentations which are based on the textbook but he doesn't post the ppt on Canvas. Professor is very bad with technology, be prepared to wait months for grades to be posted and last minute assignments. For example, at home quizzes are only available for 24 hours but they are only 5 questions. Our section 0201 is way behind the syllabus like 4 classes behind due to him explaining every slide for 5 minutes. He tries to include everyone and ask the class questions so you won't be bored or fall asleep. He is overall a great guy and very passionate about what he teaches. He's also willing to network with students and provide you with professional opportunities if you ask. There is no writing assignments in the class, he hates reading essays and short answers so exams and quizzes are all multiple choice. That being said, our section was the first to use VR headsets as an additional module so we had to write warehousing reports almost every week, which he slowly grades. My group didn't really like the VR module though because it was completely outside of class and didn't tie in with class material well.",4,B+,2023-04-03T17:13:47.864253Z
Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"This class/professor may be for some people, but I found this class painful to be apart of. While the concepts are relatively simple, and the material is not too bad, I can't stand the way he teaches or the way the course has been structured. Your entire grade is based on in-class exam grades, there is no cheating your way into a good grade. Some people may find his lectures entertaining, he is pretty enthusiastic and engaging, I will give him credit for that, but I personally hated them. He goes ON and ON about certain things and speeds through other slides so quick you don't have time to even write down what they say. He pounds your head in every class trying to drill home some of the most basic concepts. Not to mention, its a crime were not allowed to take notes on computers, especially when I physically can't write as fast as I type. It's the end of the semester and we completely missed 2 chapters and an entire quiz (5% of our grade). He has yet to even explain himself. He has nothing to grade (auto-grades in canvas), and doesn't even hold in person office hours- it exudes a lazy attitude. I actually met with him once outside of class and he comes off very self-centered and narcissistic. He asks you questions about your major and what I want to do but took very little interest in my actual answer and ended up interrupting me to talk over me. He's a nice guy I guess. He wont be rude or lack empathy, I just don't like him. I'm sure I'm not alone on this one. 

Not to mention the man teaches straight from the textbook. If he had an accurate course schedule and no participation grade, I would never go to class. I can teach my self a chapter in an hour that takes him a month to get through. I rarely consider the cost of my education in terms of classes, but this genuinely felt like a waste of my money.

Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"Good professor overall. You will have to attend lectures since he highlights the information that will be on quizzes or exams, and takes attendance. He does not post notes. Very engaging and explains content well. However, he takes a lot of time on certain topics, and ends up not following the schedule compared to the syllabus. Quizzes are basically based on what we go over in class. But some questions on the exams are based on chapters we have not gone over in class - make sure to look on the syllabus and complete the textbook readings since they aren't really covered in class. He does take a while to grade assignments and feedback.",4,A-,2023-05-19T17:22:05.402716Z
Humberto Coronado,BMGT372,"Overall, he is very knowledgeable about Supply chain management and is a lovely person. I really enjoyed the way that he lectured because I wouldn't fall asleep in his class. What I didn't like is that your grade is based only on quizzes and exams. There are no other opportunities besides the extra credit presentations, in which he interrupts the person doing the presentation and does it himself. Also, he doesn't post notes and takes FOREVER on one chapter. We missed a whole quiz this semester because of his delay in teaching, and he never gave us time to write down notes. Other than all of this, he cares about our professional success in our fields and offers help with preparing for interviews and if we need connections for internships, which is helpful.",4,B,2024-05-04T00:12:10.527000Z

He seemed very daunting at first with his no phones and no electronic policy, but I found his style and his passion to be very engaging for me. As the semester went on he got more chill.  I think his exams were very fair, and there are PLENTY of opportunities for extra credit, so when he says, ""I don't give out grades, you earn them."" That is what he means by that. As a supply chain major, honestly, I think he was an amazing professor to me. He does not follow his class schedule, though, and if that is not for you, then find someone else. He has a schedule, but he goes at his pace and feels out the class, the schedule was pretty arbitrary. He does care a lot about students and wants to see you succeed, he is willing to help, and helped me with securing an internship int he summer of 2024. He may not be the greatest professor, seems pretty quirky, and can rub people the worng way, but he is genuine, and if you want a professor like that, then take him!",5,A+,2025-02-01T20:49:36.756518Z

My polite suggestion for this is to give her some oversight, because students consider the assignments to be busy work and a joke with no real life value (and the amount of assignments is crazy for one credit). She does care about her students but is also very very rude at times. She's pretty much your basic high school english teacher.

In an assignment we're doing currently, we have to turn in written notes and share our google docs link, to curb cheating. This is so excessive and paired with it being a 1 credit class is frustrating. She a professor who does not trust her students at all, and with her strict communications guidelines, it seems like she doesn't even want to interact with students.

Usually she's not the one grading but her TA: he was great! I personally enjoyed this class due to the topics learned about, and it didn't really relate to  just law but to pop-culture AND law history. If your someone who likes learning about society and law in a fun way (such as connecting it to pop-culture) I would recommend. This semesters topic was Food injustice, and personally I enjoyed it! I did think the case briefs sucked (& I'm a business major so I found them ehh) but other than that I really enjoyed the class. If you don't like it then yes maybe the assignments would not be ""fun"" for you, but if you can take it, there's always room to learn more and grow as a student & Professional!

Exams in this class were not a joke though, probably because he held us to a high standard.  He would send us ""disappointment"" emails but it showed he cared about us getting better at the material. He curved us fairly and I somehow wound up with an A- even when I got D's on the 2nd exam and final.",5,A-,2014-01-31T02:41:00Z

Overall, Dr Tits is an excellent and very approachable lecturer who provided one of the most challenging and informative courses I and most of my classmates had ever experienced.

In other words, he gave a lot of students another chance to shape up.

Andre Tits,ENEE460,"Professor Tits is a super approachable professor that is committed to your advancing your knowledge.

He is always happy and open to helping students who stop by whenever he's in his office, even outside of his posted office hours. (He will drop whatever he's doing to help students.)

Some advice to those looking to take ENEE460 with him: Do all the homework! This develops your ability to attack questions he gives on his tests. While he also posts reading assignments, you could probably get by without them. That being said, the book can sometimes have details he might've glanced over during lecture. Listen to everything he says during lecture, especially when he talks about how to solve problems as this is likely what he expects from you on the exams. Do not fret if you bomb his midterm (I did), he gives out an optional project to boost your grade and the finals are relatively similar in problem type to his past exams.

He is very friendly and helpful if you are trying to explore the course material, it's just that he has set the bar very high and refuses to budge it.

To make up for this, Dr. Tits provides very generous opportunities for extra credit through the use of challenge problems. It was possible to achieve a flat 6% boost to your final grade this semester if you completed them all successfully. I had fun overall.",4,A-,2023-12-09T21:35:33.672203Z

Andre Tits,ENEE322,"Professor Tits is a great person and extremely knowledgeable about signals and systems.  His teaching methods however are antiquated, and it is assumed that you enter the class basically knowing all of pre-requisite fringe math, like complex numbers as well as working with calculus and complex numbers at a very low level.  As the previous 2024 review has said, the average for midterm 1 was below passing, and the lowest score was about a 2% on the midterm.  Keeping in mind that the grading is 25% 25% 40% and 10% for two midterms, a final, and hw/quizzes respectively, it is highly likely that similar to previous semesters about half the people drop the class before the second midterm.  Given that he may have ""nice teacher"" policies like final forgiveness/passing or the rare extra credit, him as a professor is nice, however he does not keep in mind that students at the very least need to pass the class if not understand it.  Additionally, since he started using a different professor's slides this semester, he has gone warp speed through the material to the pace he thinks is good, causing 2nd exam material to be possibly included on exam 1, and Final exam material to be included on exam 2.

PROS:
* Very knowledgeable on signals
* Approachable and was genuinely kind
* Held review sessions
* Gave a caveat that if you got a B on the final, you would pass the class, regardless of your grade overall

CONS:
* Failed nearly half the class due to inability to effectively teach signals and systems
* Exams were very difficult, as averages for the first two midterms were around a 50%. On top of that, grading for the exams were quite harsh
* Confused many times by his own work and had to have students answer questions that he was not able to figure out
* Chicken scratch handwriting that required a rosetta stone to decode
* Homeworks that took an ungodly amount of time due to minimal examples being gone over in class
* No other resource other than his lecture-only notes or the lengthy textbook",1,C-,2024-05-08T02:45:25.935827Z

Andre Tits,ENEE322,"To preface, Andre did end up failing half the class, and this is pretty common with this professor. BUT ALSO KNOW THAT A 60% is THE C- CUTOFF, which not everyone knew.
Exams are tough, and are 90% of your grade. He's also not very generous when it comes to partial credit. He has this mindset of ""Students need to meet a certain standard/expectation in order to pass the class"", and it's a pretty high expectation.
Obviously if you have the opportunity to take it with Papamarcou you should, but if you're stuck with Tits, be ready to grind. A lot of work outside of lecture and discussions, and routinely go to office hours just to practice/learn more. 
Tits himself isn't the most engaging lecturer, he's a pretty slow speaker and he often messes up his words/not understand questions well, but he is very nice. I recommend going to an office hour so he can get to know you. He also holds exam review sessions where he really shows how much he cares about your learning. 
Homework's can be pretty lengthy and there are potential pop quizzes in discussion which more or less force you to go every week. He also does optional challenge problems which can add up to a potential 5-6% of your final grade. 
As long as you don't absolutely bomb your first midterm, you'll be set, the stuff you learn in the 2nd half of the semester is easier compared to the 1st.",3,B-,2024-05-14T20:57:39.266177Z
Andre Tits,ENEE322,"This was one of the toughest classes that I've taken at this university but I truly believe that I learned more from this class than any single class I've taken before. Going in to this class, you have to be pretty confident in your math background and you really have to want to learn rather than get the grade. Professor Tits makes it so that if you truly know the content, the grade will come naturally as long as you put the work in. 
Homeworks are pretty long but they cover all of the content and are really good to prepare you for exams. I found myself doing the homework once on my own, checking my answers with my friend (not simply changing my work but thinking ""I wonder how they got this, let me check my line of reasoning""), working out the problems again, and then submitting my work. I learned most from my mistakes and the homeworks provided a low stakes, environment to make those mistakes. The best thing was that the homeworks were usually much more difficult than the exams. There are also quizzes in this class but they are always on the homework that was due that week and the lowest quiz is dropped. Homeworks and quizzes made up 10% of the grade. Quizzes are during discussion which were also super useful because the TA teaches a lot of tips and tricks that can be used to solve the homeworks and exams. 
The two midterms were each worth 25% of the grade each, which is more than I had ever seen before. They were not easy exams but they definitely checked if you knew the content well. The first midterm average was low but that is pretty common in the class. STICK WITH IT. After many people had dropped the class (only 17/30 was left), the exams actually got easier and Professor Tits introduced a ""curve"" where if you got a B- on the final, no matter what grade you had in the class before then, you will pass. Not to mention, the grading scale was pretty generous where 60% was the C- cutoff and 75% was the B- cutoff (he didn't change the A- cutoff from 90%). The final exam was cumulative and worth 40% of the grade but 2 out of the 4 questions came directly from the homework (not even changed, literally copy/pasted). 
This class, and Professor Tits, made me want to do a specialization in controls because of how interested I am in the content and because of how well he taught it. I found his lectures to be extremely well paced (some people found it slow because he does stop and think at times but it gives you some good time to think about what he just said). His lecture and class style are also a little old but I found it refreshing since I learn better in this style, rather than flipped classrooms or video lectures to watch before class that other professors are opting to do nowadays. Outside of class, I went to every office hours to ask him questions or just have him help me through problems because it was rare that other people took advantage of his office hours. By the end of the semester, he knew me and the others who went to office hours well and we all did well in the class. The last thing I wanted to mention was extra credit- he put out 3 extra credit problems, each that would add 2% to your final grade in the class for only the first 3 people who got the correct answer. These were incredibly difficult problems but because I attempted them, it helped my grade and my math skills so I'd suggest to always take a stab. Overall with Dr. Tits, you will get out what you put in but you have to put a lot in if you want the A.",5,A+,2024-05-16T15:31:01.847761Z

Multiple students had difficulties this semester, some not even COVID related, however she had no empathy towards these students and giving them extensions, and instead told them to withdrawal from the course. Was one of the most unreachable professors ever; you could email her and she would instead just forward the email to her TA Tyra (who is absolutely amazing) to have her respond instead. Would cancel office hour appointments 5 minutes before the scheduled time. Won't explain why you got points off because it's ""in the rubric."" Only sees things her way.

Martha Nell Smith,ENGL250,"If you come across this class for some reason, let me save you a semester of HELL. RUN THE OTHER WAY! AND NEVER LOOK BACK! I initially thought I was registering for Engl250, not knowing that it was also referred as WMST255- it makes a HUGE difference. I have never regretted a class like this one since I've been at the university. The professor is just a closed minded bigot- if it's not her opinion, a. its wrongs, b. it doesn't matter and c. you WILL FAIL!! No consideration for the fact that students have other classes. This should not be considered a CORE- this is a freaking 400level class, i swear! 3 papers (10%, 15%, 25%), a final (25%), discussion- including random quizzes in disc sec and lecture when she's mad cuz no one shows up to class, or someone leaves early, and 5 discussion posts(25%). T.A.'s are fickle- one minute their helping you, the next, they don't even respond to your emails. Don't even bother emailing the professor-she won't respond.She openly discriminates against the guys in the class, and it's just sick! I'm a girl, and I kept an open mind about women's studies but honestly-it's a bunch of bull, common sense that's spun into nice little themes and lessons designed to fool the students into believing that there's actually some profound thought, and critical thinking going on. The Amount of reading- surpassed all my other classes combined! One of the books we had to purchase- Norton's anthology of literature by women: all I ask is that you look this book up, and see how many pages it has, and I promise you, no page will go unturned!!! Never mind the fact that she doesn't go over half of the lecture slides in lecture, but still holds you accountable. This teacher definitely ruined any hopes of me liking the subject. I'm telling you- RUN FOR THE HILLS!!! Don't say I didn't warn you.   ",1,,2011-12-27T06:45:00Z
Martha Nell Smith,ENGL250,"Dr. Smith knows what she's talking about, but the whole class seems to have no main message. There is an insane amount of reading including very long critic articles required, and at least 5 pop quizzes are given throughout the semester so you've got to make sure you do the readings. There were so many ""themes"" in the class and readings that studying for the final (pretty much our only grade next to 3 papers) became very difficult. Discussion class is fun and really helps understand the reading outside of the unclear power points presented in class, but sadly that was only 50 minutes once a week. ",3,,2011-11-17T16:59:00Z

She does teach one-sided, but it's kind of your fault if you didn't expect that when you signed up for a WOMENS LIT course. Grades depend entirely on your TA, so try and switch to a good one during the first week of classes. There is a lot of reading, but you can definitely sparknotes and skim things and still keep up. Some of the literature is a little graphic, but there is a pretty good mix of readings. It isn't the easiest CORE class, but if you can write decent papers you should be fine. Also, if it is in KEY 0106 like it was last Fall be prepared for some extreme temperatures, it was always really hot or really cold.",3,A,2011-06-02T14:17:00Z

Definitely make the effort to go to office hours and participate in discussions. I don't really recommend this course, there is so much reading that it is nearly impossible to keep up with.

Prof. Smith is very one sided with the information given and if you don't agree then your grade will be greatly affected. 3 papers, each having difficult prompts that you will either understand or you will completely write off topic. We had 2 TAs for the class one was an easy grader and the other was very difficult to please. There are random pop quizzes that start off only in discussion, but once people start not showing up to lecture many were in lecture. She puts the power points on blackboard, but they are hardly notes mostly just general questions of what it is like to read the readings. There is an unbelievable amount of readings that is very difficult to keep up with even if you read a couple each day, the understanding of having other classes is not seen here.

Martha Nell Smith,WMST255,"This is what i said for my course evaluation. I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO TAKE THIS COURSE FOR THE REASONS I LIST BELOW!
The teaching style of the course was abysmal, it is completely unfair to base so much of our grade on such short papers. Having a 1 page paper be worth 10% of our grade (a 2-3 page paper worth 15% of our grade), is an unfair way of evaluating our knowledge of the readings. Furthermore, we were supposed to have writing workshops before our papers were due and we haven't had any and we aren't having one on our last paper. Without writing workshops, I have been unable to improve my writing thus I have received bad grades on both of my papers. I wish the criteria for the papers was clear, so that we could know what we are being evaluated on. The grading seems to be very random, and it seems unfair that I was penalized for following the assignment on my second paper. Also, having a final exam and pop quizzes in a literature class is annoying because the class should be more about papers and less about memorizing which poet wrote which poem. Overall, I would NEVER recommend this course to another student. I think the course needs to be revamped first, by limited the number of students who enroll. Having a literature class with 180 students is stupid. In lectures with such a large number of students, it is impossible to really discuss the readings. Also, when we don't start class until 2:10 when the class is supposed to start at 2:00 we lose out on much needed time. The readings were entirely too long and were often boring. It is crazy to assume that we will remember the names, authors, and summaries for so many poems. Furthermore, they were difficult to understand and we did not have adequate class time to discuss all of the readings. Having class twice a week for 50 minutes just isn't enough time given the amount of readings we have to go over. We often didn't have time to get through all of the slides, but we were still responsible for the material? That's just insane because it isn't our fault that the lecture time is so limited. Overall, the expectations for this course are way too high for an intro level class, and I hope that the course can be changed to make it better because I feel that this topic is extremely important.",1,,2010-04-29T20:36:00Z

If you never do any other work for the class, which is very possible because he gives very little homework that is actually due, keep up with the new vocab. The quizzes and tests always have a couple sections on vocab and it's an easy way to get points. Whereas after 3 semesters of learning the same verb tenses, you either know them or you don't.

I give the other people credit who actually did the work, especially the ones who struggled through the class, simply because it just didn't come that easy to them or some other reason.

That being said, Falvo is an awesome professor. He usually comes to class 5 minutes late (on average), doesn't speak a mile a minute so he's easy to understand. A couple days during class we would bring in cookies and stuff and make espresso in class.

Although lectures can sometimes be a drag in the morning, all you need to do is pay attention and you're guaranteed an A. She's also very considerate to needs and will even take time out of lecture to go over things like proper citations and paper writing. 
There are only five oppurtunities for grades (attendance/participation, short narrative, final paper, midterm and final) but as long as you go to class and turn in the assignments you'll be just fine. Most of the class is common sense anyways.
It's helpful to take notes to help you understand the topics a bit more, but as long as you rememeber the main events and a few concepts the essay exams are straightforward. Go to the review session the class before and you'll be set.

Attendance and participation are graded; I participated only a couple times throughout the semester and got a much higher score than I expected, so don't worry too much about it if speaking up is something you dislike doing. She provides extra credit opportunities through attending Asian American-related events, which I thought was a very interesting and engaging way of encouraging students to learn outside of the classroom. There were very few things to be graded on, though--besides the participation grade, there were only two essays and a midterm + final. That means that there's not much to do throughout the semester besides attending class and learning, but your grade heavily depends on a very small amount of things. The weirdest thing about the class was that she would remove her powerpoint slides from elms after a week or two, not sure why she did that.

HIST120 has a good bit of reading and a lot of dates. Building a chronology is pretty much essential to doing well in the class. However, the material is incredibly interesting and I learned a significant amount about Islamic culture because of it.

Easily my favorite class so far at Maryland and highly recommended.",5,A,2012-09-24T19:31:00Z
Antoine Borrut,HIST120,"I took HIST120 my freshman year and fell in love with Islamic history all because of Professor Borrut. He is one of the top professors at Maryland. Not only does he know what he's talking about, but he passes on that knowledge in an interesting and clear way. He wants you to learn, and it shows. He is extremely available and helping his students excel is his main priority.

HIST120 is a basic introduction to early Islamic history, and is not too hard. There are 3 essay exams, but you review in discussion, so you have no reason to be unprepared for the questions. Discussion is mandatory, and you discuss certain readings. You can guess which reading is going to be discussed so you do not need to read them all.

I loved Professor Borrut's class so much that I decided to take HIST429Y with him. This class was much more difficult than 120, but it was very interesting and we were able to discuss topics in depth which was great. The readings can be hard to keep up with, but as long as you do 2 of them or are good at bs-ing in class you'll be fine. The papers are only based on that week's readings so don't worry about keeping up with each article in depth. The papers are long but not so difficult. I would recommend giving in a rough draft beforehand for him to look at so you can edit to make it what he is looking for. I'm a business major, and got A's on all of my papers.

You definitely do not have to do all of it to get As on every assignment, but the less reading you do as it is assigned, the harder the assignments become.

Homework assignment on the second half of the semester to up to 10 hours to do. And they had nothing to do with the exams because you cant use excel on the exams, but he expects you to know how excel calculated it and for you to show it on the exam. 

He did not give ANY practice exams. We all just groped in the dark, guessing for questions for practice. I think he's lazy and tries to recycle materials from semester to semester and doesn't want students to see the past ones. 

Also he does not give you your exams back. If grading was incorrect you will never know about it. He makes the exams cumulative but he doesn't give you back exams so you have no idea what you need to work on more for the next exam.

Michel Cukier,ENME392,"I honestly get the impression he is teaching this course not out of desire, but necessity. 

Be *very* careful with this teacher; he purposefully quickly glosses over information and AVOIDS explaining it when he intended to have a clicker question on it or emphasize it on the exam. This isn't always the case, but often is. 

He is very passive aggressive in his teaching style. When he makes a mistake on his custom made homework problems since he worded it unnecessarily vaguely, he says it's your fault for not assuming X, Y, or Z, when it could very well be that the assumption could be invalid if you interpret the data differently. 

Students actively argue with him about his homework problems, which are often UNNESSARY. If he assigned just book problems, they would be bearable. But a HUGE amount of time always goes into trying to interpret his custom problems, NOT into actually applying the material. 

I did very well on the first exam but awful on the second exam as I had ZERO sleep due to staying up all night trying to play catch up for my other classes after one of his god awful homeworks that I had to spend my entire weekend + monday in order to complete with some understanding of the material. So I was a complete wreck for his exam. 

In a nutshell: he has a very typical professor-complex where he considers his class the only one in existance and expects you to ""get rid of conflicts"" if you can't attend the problem solving sessions on friday. Sorry sir, you cannot ask a student to drop classes just to attend the friday sessions. That is not only egotistical but also unethical. This a 3 credit class that you assign 6-9 credits worth of work per week. 

I've researching the necessary paperwork to report this teacher to the academic board; his unethical practices are negligent and destructive. If you do not like to teach, please leave. I shouldn't pay you tons of money to berate us in class. ",2,B,2010-11-13T15:50:00Z
Michel Cukier,ENME392,"This guy is a horrible lecturer.  His lectures don't help (learning from the book is better) and he is bad at answering questions.  When asking questions during class, he will be easily confused with your question and probably give you a BS answer like ""it depends what you're doing"" and continue on with lecture. 

He gives the worst clicker questions at the end of his lectures (usually 2 or 3 questions) which are on some mundane detail of his lecture he went over for 30 seconds. These count for 5% of your grade (syllabus is not clear).  

He gives more homework than my other engineering classes (like 12-20 problems per week along with analyzing raw data).  Also, he'll take off 2% of your final grade if you don't pick up your homework from his office.  Seriously, wtf??

Tests are tricky on purpose, so you'll need to be very careful reading the problem over and over.  They are long and you'll need to be proficient to finish on time.

He does hold problem solving sessions on Fridays (can't go to them because of class), but I hear they are largely useless like his lectures. 

Overall, one of the worst professors I've had, especially for a course that needs a lot of careful explanation.",2,,2010-11-02T16:54:00Z
Michel Cukier,ENME392,"Michel is a difficult professor to put a grade to.

His lectures are largely useless even though he does put them online.  They are very scattered and doesn't show work, so often it looks like he just jumps to the answer with no explanation.  

The worst part of the lectures was the clickers at the end.  There are 2 questions that are graded as quizzes.  The questions are usually about some very minuscule detail and his wording is sometimes very unclear.  If you have him, I recommend bringing the textbook or his lecture notes and looking up the answers because he allows this.

Sample exams: ""How do you mean sample exams?"" was one of his quotes from the year. He does not give sample exams and his regular exams are very hard and curves them to around a 75% average.

Homework: Gives a lot of homework but pays more attention to effort, though the correct answer does count.

Availability: He makes himself very available to students and is very approachable and a nice guy, and is always willing to help out students.

His accent was somewhat of a barrier, but once you learn what certain words are, it's not too bad.

The curve at the end seemed pretty large because the average grade was very low. I'm sure you could do worse than Cukier, but I'm sure you could do better as well.",3,A,2010-08-29T14:19:00Z
Michel Cukier,HACS200,"""Dumpster fire"" barely suffices to describe the horror of this course.

TLDR: 
course: absolute train-wreck, 0/10 would not take again. The students being so happy that a course is over is really something.
instructor: performance beyond awful in running the course and for encouraging p-hacking. Would rate 0 stars if I could.

First and foremost, this was way to much work for a 2cr 200-lv course.

Lack of documentation / spec doesn't help either. 
Using MITM software provided by the course staff is virtually required, which wouldn't be too bad except for the fact that it's broken and lacks documentation.
Important bug fixes to it were made multiple weeks into the semester, and the entire setup relies on deprecated packages, so updating breaks it.
Even after those fixes, it's still bugged. (This is treating the ""it's a feature, not a bug"" aspects as features)

Next up is asinine / lack of grading criteria. 
Initially, assignments at least had rubrics provided. (Marking in adherence to the rubrics, not so much)
Peer reviews were used to give feedback (rather than instructional staff) for a large assignment early on, which wouldn't be an issue if the peer review comments correlated with the marks given.
Grades were assigned here pretty arbitrarily, using justifications like 'this section was not 2 pages' (paraphrased) to deduct points from groups that had slightly above 2 pages as well as those with slightly below.
With margins though, no group could possibly have exactly 2 pages. 

Early on, there were also marks for more subjective things like presentations, for which grades were not released until months later.
The thing is, no rubric was used in grading these -- just ""a general feel[ing]"" (direct quote). (???) This is MONTHS after the actual presentation! 
I barely remember what my teammates talked about, much less little details of other groups; there is no way the course staff remembers details sufficient to assign meaningful grades months later.

When confronted about this, though, they doubled down and refused to provide grading criteria for the final presentation/paper.
Now, rumor has it that Dr. Cukier was attempting (successfully?) to make the course appear ""rigorous"" by assigning low grades.
I personally have no evidence of this one way or another, but consider this case:

The course staff told students that our proposals (worth about 20% of the overall grade) would be rejected and we would be asked to repeatedly revise them if they were not sufficiently well written.
However, one entire group's proposal was accepted and subsequently scored 11.3/20 (probably 11.25 actually due to ELMS rounding) -- an F (mean was 15.3/20). 
""F denotes failure to understand the subject and unsatisfactory performance."" An unsatisfactory proposal should have been rejected, no? 

While other students undoubtedly have a long list of grievances about this course, I'll just touch on this one.
He actively encouraged p-hacking (see https://xkcd.com/882/) to groups who initially failed to reject their null hypotheses.
This included suggesting ""regrouping the data"" and even as far as ""just looking at one week [of 1-2 months worth]"" (paraphrased).
This is questionable at best, and most researchers view it as cheating in the experiment -- perhaps just shy of scientific fraud.",1,B,2018-12-13T22:53:30Z
Michel Cukier,ENME392,"This is by far the worst course I’ve taken at UMD. The professors are incompetent, constantly retracting their own statements and overall a complete disgrace to the university. The course layout is awful and inefficient. We are expected to watch all lecture videos and do homework before coming to class which begs the question, Why even come to class? Furthermore the professors instruct us to asks further questions on Piazza, which they have frequently neglected to answers for multiple days on pressing issues. Cuckier is frequently wrong in his demonstrations which only further confuses students, while Fuge insults is by only asking for “high level questions”   Lastly, no one can ever seem to give a straight answer without having to “confer” which in other words means they will never tell you the answer and are dodging the question. The worst part of all is the use of prarie learn. Each question must be completed twice to get full credit but if a student doesn’t compete one single part of a question, they have no way of earning any points on the second attempt. Furthermore the exams use instant feedback which i will admit is nice, but the professors don’t even bother with partial credit which destroys all hope of earning credit for displaying what you know.",1,,2021-04-30T05:15:31Z
Michel Cukier,ENME392,"Let this be a warning to anyone that has to take it with either Cukier or Fuge. Granted they may teach it differently once things are back in person, but being taught through zoom and asynchronous videos was just a huge mess to deal with it. Cukier, you won't understand his notes at all unless you've been keeping up with lecture to the dot. The notes that he does during lecture are a joke, typing out the solution makes interpreting his work difficult since this class is heavy on the notations. Its quite the headache. 
The HW you have to do is extremely tedious and time consuming, granted I didn't expect it to be a walk in the park, but they are very long and take time too. 
By the way, they also catch you off guard with how heavily emphasized MATLAB is used in the course. So if you haven't coded before or barely utilized it you're in for a great time. 
Tests are extremely challenging, there's a reason why the averages are low, you can't get partial credit, unlike a normal practical exam you can still get some sort of credit for attempting it. Here however, you only can salvage some credit when you get the question RIGHT. So really its either all or nothing with these exams.
Ultimately you're gonna take an L with whichever statistics professor you have. This department needs to be investigated.",1,,2021-05-22T03:44:47Z
Michel Cukier,ENME442,"Everything everyone has said about Cukier is true. He is not the professor to take for any class. I don't care if you really want to take the class, I promise he will ruin it for you. He doesn't lecture well. His notes are useless to follow. He doesn't give clear expectations on assignments and then grades with scrutiny. He doesn't provide rubrics. It took him an entire semester to grade our midterms. We received our 1st midterm grade after we already took the 2nd midterm. The 2nd midterm had repeat content from the first so I got it wrong twice not knowing my error until I spoke to my friend about it. He is definitely passive aggressive about the way he teaches. He will not give you a full picture of the course content that will be on the exam and try putting in ""gotchas"" on the exams to lower our grades. All of his 442 exam questions are written in a way which lets him subjectively grade them and the exams are not returned for you to review where you lost points.

Michel Cukier,ENME442,"This class is abysmal. He sold it as one thing in the beginning of the semester and the class ended up being totally different to how he described it. We had to use security tools for our homework and he never mentioned how to use them once during the entire course. I literally had to Youtube how to do every homework assignment and some of them took way longer than they should have just trying to figure out how to use them. He spent every lecture talking about nonsense for the first 20 minutes at least and when he was teaching his lecture slides were harder to decipher than hieroglyphics. His tests are dumb and usually had barely anything to do with what we learned in class. A trainwreck is a generous description of this abomination of a class. If you need any more convincing, he literally spent half of one lecture talking about how one of his former students who works in IT emailed him and roasted him because his class is not useful for learning about information security at all. I put in so much effort into this course and still feel like I’ve barely learned anything useful. It’s a god damn shame because I like the subject material and find informaton security interesting, but this class made me question why I’m paying for a college education.

He does not even know himself how to use Matlab. His office hours are useless. He does not know how to answer any sort of question unless it is a question that he has an answer key for. The exams are at least pretty easy. The homework rely on Matlab. but even the TA's do not know hot to grade them properly.
